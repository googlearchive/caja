\abstract

Using Caja, web apps can safely allow scripts in third party content.

The computer industry has only one significant success enabling documents to 
carry active content safely: scripts in web pages. Normal users regularly 
browse untrusted sites with JavaScript turned on. Modulo browser bugs and 
phishing, they mostly remain safe. But even though web apps build on this 
success, they fail to provide its power. Web apps generally remove scripts 
from third party content, reducing content to passive data. Examples include 
webmail, groups, blogs, chat, docs and spreadsheets, wikis, and more; whether 
from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, HP, Wikipedia, or others.

Were scripts in an object-capability language, web apps could provide active 
content safely, simply, and flexibly. Surprisingly, this is possible within 
existing web standards. Caja represents our discovery that a subset of 
JavaScript is an object-capability language.

\section{Introduction}

In a memory-safe object language such as JavaScript, object A can only invoke 
object B if A has a reference to B. If A already has references to B and C, A 
can invoke B passing C as an argument, giving B access to C. Memory-safe 
object language with encapsulation, such as Java, \emph{protect objects from 
their outside world}. The clients of an encapsulated object can make requests 
using its public interface. But how an object reacts to a request is up to 
the object. An encapsulated object can ensure that causality can only enter 
it according to the object model of computation.

An \emph{object-capability language} is essentially a memory-safe object 
language with encapsulation, with additional restrictions that \emph{protect 
the outside world from the objects}.\footnote{
%
Thanks to Mark Lillibridge for this formulation.
%
} In an object-capability language, an object can only cause effects outside 
itself by using the references it holds to other objects. Objects have no 
powerful references by default, and are granted new references only by normal 
message passing rules. Object references thereby become the sole 
representation of rights to affect the world, and normal message passing is 
the only rights transfer mechanism. An object can be denied authority simply 
by not giving it those references which would provide that authority.

The browser sandbox already mostly protects the world outside the browser 
from scripts running on web pages. A great virtue of JavaScript is that many 
people successfully program in it casually, without first learning the 
language in any depth. Caja\footnote{
%
\emph{Caja} is Spanish for ``box''. With Caja, \textbf{c}apabilities 
\textbf{a}ttenuate \textbf{J}avaScript \textbf{a}uthority.
%
} is an enforced subset of JavaScript we designed to make as little impact as 
possible on regular JavaScript programming, while still providing 
object-capability security. In this section, we provide a brief inaccurate 
overview of the differences between Caja and JavaScript suitable for the 
casual JavaScript programmer. The rest of this document then accurately goes 
into more depth.

\begin{description}

  \item[Forbidden names.] Caja rejects all names ending with ``\_\_'' (double 
  underscore). This gives the Caja implementation a place to store its 
  bookkeeping information where it is invisible to the Caja programmer.
 
  \item[Frozen objects.] If an object is frozen, an attempt to set, add, or 
  delete its properties will throw an exception instead. Functions and 
  prototypes are implicitly frozen. In addition, the Caja programmer can 
  explicitly freeze objects to prevent their direct modification. All objects 
  in the default global environment are \emph{immutable}, or transitively 
  frozen.
 
  \item[No shared global environment.] Each separately loaded module has its 
  own global environment which inherits from the default global environment, 
  isolating them from each other.

  \item[Private names.] Property names ending in ``\_'' (single underscore) 
  serve as protected instance variables. Such names can only appear to the 
  right of ``\code{this.}''. As with Smalltalk instance variables or 
  \code{protected} instance variables in C++, these protected instance 
  variables are visible up and down the inheritance chain within an object, 
  but are not visible outside an object.
 
  \item[No method stealing.] The single underscore rule above only protects 
  an object's state from its clients if its clients cannot add methods to it 
  which alias its ``\code{this}''. Caja divides functions into three 
  categories: \emph{simple functions} are those which do not mention 
  ``\code{this}''. They are first class and can be used without further 
  restriction. \emph{Constructors} are named functions which mention 
  ``\code{this}''. \emph{Methods} are anonymous function which mention 
  ``\code{this}''.

  Neither constructors nor methods are first class. They can be used in ways 
  that support stereotyped class-like JavaScript programming patterns, but 
  they cannot be stored in variables or passed as arguments. Fortunately, 
  there's no loss of generality. The Caja programmer can obtain the same 
  effect by wrapping a constructor or a method in a simple function (such as 
  \code{F.make} in Figure~\ref{fig:func-obj}) and passing that simple 
  function instead.
 
  \item[Sharp knives removed.] Caja contains no ``\code{with}'' or 
  ``\code{eval}''. Caja bundles in a safe JSON library to support the most 
  common use of \code{eval}.
 
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{alltt}
function F(x) \{ this.x_ = x; \}
F.prototype.getX = function() \{
  return this.x_;
\};
F.make = function(x) \{
  return new F(x);
\};
function test() \{
  return new F(3).getX() === 3;
\}
\end{alltt}

\caption[Caja Functions]{Caja Functions. \code{F} is a \emph{constructor}. It 
can only be initialized and used with \code{new} and \code{instanceof}. 
\code{F.prototype.getX} is a \emph{method}. It can only be called as a 
method. \code{F.make} and \code{test} are \emph{simple functions}. They can 
be passed around freely.}
\label{fig:func-obj}
\end{figure}

Hopefully, this is all the casual Caja programmer needs to know to get 
started. Section~\ref{sec:epicycles} explains a bit of the history of access 
control in the web browser, in order to motivate the problems Caja addresses. 
It may safely be skipped. Section~\ref{sec:subset} explains the problems 
faced when securing JavaScript, many of which involve the use of 
``\code{this}''. 

We then present Caja in two stages. Section~\ref{sec:cajita-spec} presents 
\emph{Cajita}, the subset of Caja without ``\code{this}''. For new code, 
Cajita is a reasonably expressive language resembling an object-oriented 
Scheme. Section~\ref{sec:caja-spec} then presents the remainder of the Caja 
language beyond Cajita. Caja adds back enough of JavaScript for most old 
habits and old code to port pleasantly and painlessly. Caja and Cajita 
interoperate without problems. Section~\ref{sec:related} briefly surveys
related work.



\section{Identity-centric Epicycles}
\label{sec:epicycles}

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{seesaw-pola}}
  
\caption[The Evolving Authority of Active Content]{The Evolving Authority of 
Active Content. Identity-centric access controls have led to thrashing 
between lost functionality and lost safety. To have both, we need to provide 
\emph{least authority}: adequate authority for desired functionality without 
excess authority which invites abube.}
  \label{fig:evo-auth}
\end{figure}

When a document contains live interactive programs, we say it contains 
\emph{active content}. The computer industry has spent over a billion dollars 
in failed attempts to support active content. But the success of web 
apps---themselves a form of active content---demonstrates that this dream was 
worth pursuing. Unfortunately, web developers today face a maze of complex 
security mechanisms that have, so far, prevented web apps themselves from 
supporting active content. To navigate our way out of this maze, we must 
first see how we got here.

Today's desktop operating systems all use some form of identity-centric 
access control~\cite{karp:abac-soa}, in which an installed application runs 
\emph{as} its user, and so is entrusted with all its user's authority. Such 
an application can provide its user all the functionality modern operating 
systems support, but at the price of being able to do anything its user may 
do. We depict this situation at~\q{2} on Figure~\ref{fig:evo-auth}. When you 
run Solitaire, it can delete all your files while playing within the rules of 
your system, without exploiting any bugs. (For the remainder of this 
document, we will ignore hazards due to implementation bugs, and explain only 
hazards due to architectural choices.)

At first, the documents handled by applications were safe passive data~\q{1}. 
Applications first supported active content by running scripts in documents 
with all of their user's authority~\qq{1}{2}. Excess authority invites abuse. 
Simply ``reading'' a malicious document would allow it to delete all your 
files. In reaction, installed office applications now encourage users to 
disable scripts (Figure~\ref{fig:dialog}) reducing content back to passive 
data~\qq{2}{1}. The failures of excess authority shown on the upper left thus 
led to the failures of inadequate authority shown on the lower right.

The web browser is itself an installed application that runs scripts in two 
contexts. Browser extensions run with all the user's authority~\q{2}. Scripts 
in web pages run sandboxed, with no authority to the user's local files. The 
browser's \emph{same origin policy}, another layer of identity-centric 
control~\cite{mashupos}, provides scripts with the authority to communicate 
with their site of origin~\qq{1}{3}. Regarding both decisions, the user is 
helpless. The user has no practical way to grant a script the authority to 
edit one of the user's local files, nor can the user deny a script the 
ability to call home. So long as the user's valuable assets were local, this 
model successfully protected the user.

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{dialog}}
  
\caption[Only Bad Choices.]{Only Bad Choices. When documents contain scripts, 
users can disable themselves from getting any work done \q{1} or enable 
scripts to destroy all their other work \q{2}.}
  \label{fig:dialog}
\end{figure}

Web apps leverage this success. To the browser, the page on which a web app 
resides is a document, and the web app itself is simply active content within 
that document. But to the user, a web app is an application managing yet 
other documents on the user's behalf. For example, when the user interacts 
with webmail, the documents of interest are email messages. Likewise for 
groups, blogs, chat, docs and spreadsheets, wikis, and more. Let us refer to 
the documents managed by web apps as \emph{passages}, to distinguish them 
from the web pages on which they appear.

Since the user can neither grant a web app access to local files nor deny it 
the ability to call home, the only place a web app could store these passages 
is on its site of origin. The browser security model protected the user's 
local files from being harmed \emph{or used}. As users shift to using web 
apps, the assets they value come to be the passages stored at these various 
origin sites. 

To protect their user's remote passages, web apps employed yet another layer 
of identity-centric controls, relying on cookies or other forms of 
authentication to identify their user. But when scripts within these passages 
ran, they would run within the web page containing the web app serving them, 
and were thereby authorized to do anything their web app could do on behalf 
of its user~\q{4}. For example, if a webmail application allowed HTML email 
messages to carry scripts, simply ``reading'' an incoming email message would 
allow it to delete your inbox. The~\qq{3}{4} transition is not a technical 
change, but a change in where the user's value resides, and thus a change in 
the user's risks. By this dynamic, failures of inadequate authority led to 
failures of excess authority.

To protect against malicious passages, some web apps do safely provide active 
content using \emph{iframes}---effectively nested web pages---at the cost of 
isolating themselves from this content~\qq{4}{3}~\cite{mashupos}. Most web 
apps \emph{sanitize} HTML content by removing all scripts, reducing content 
again to passive data~\qq{4}{1}. Existing HTML sanitizers disinfect the 
patient but leave a corpse. This recapitulates the loss of active content in 
installed office applications. Some proposals would address these next 
incremental problems by adding yet another identity-centric 
epicycle. Can we do better?

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{epicycles}}

  \caption[Ptolomy's epicycles.]{Ptolomy's epicycles. Ptolomy attempted to
  model the motion of the heavenly bodies using only circles. With each
  discovery that the model didn't fit, yet another layer of circle was added
  to adjust. By contrast, Kepler's ellipses fit the problem directly, with no
  need for endless additional layers.}
\end{figure}

If we could start over again, we could use an authorization-centric model 
such as object-capabilities~\cite{DVH}. The object-capability alternative 
naturally supports POLA, the principle of least authority, shown in the upper 
right of Figure~\ref{fig:evo-auth}. An object in an object-capability 
language can only cause effects by invoking the public interfaces of objects 
it can reach. An invocation provides references to other objects as 
arguments, providing the invoked object the least authority needed to carry 
out these requests~\cite{RobustComposition}. Within these rules, active 
content would run with exactly the authority explicitly provided by its 
containing document. Surprisingly, we can gain these benefits simply by 
applying a milder, non-lethal sanitizer.

Experience with Java, Scheme, OCaml, Pict, and others demonstrates that 
existing memory safe languages often already contain an expressive 
object-capability subset~\cite[respectively]{joe-e, rees96security, emily, 
backwater}. We refer to the object-capability subset of JavaScript as 
\emph{Caja}. The Caja translator restricts the JavaScript it accepts to be 
within this subset. This sanitized JavaScript is still a general purpose 
object programming language which JavaScript programmers should find 
familiar, pleasant, expressive, and easy to learn and use.

Some web apps could use the Caja translator to allow active content in their 
passages~\qq{1}{5}. Other web apps could use Caja to overcome the limits of 
iframes~\qq{3}{5}. Browser extensions, which run with their user's full 
authority, could make a \emph{powerbox} available to scripts in 
pages~\cite{darpareview, stiegler:polaris, seaborn:plash, bitfrost}. A web 
app, on detecting the presence of a powerbox, could offer to edit a local 
file chosen by the user~\qq{4}{6}.

Our starting point is JavaScript 1.5 as documented in the third edition of 
the EcmaScript 262 standard~\cite{ECMA-262}; hereafter \emph{ES3}. The 
remainder of this document explains the differences between Caja---the 
JavaScript subset accepted by the Caja translator---and ES3. Other documents 
will explain Caja's sanitization of the remaining elements of active web 
content: HTML, CSS, and the DOM and other APIs provided by browsers to 
JavaScript. We refer collectively to the subset of these accepted by the 
Caja translator as \emph{Caja web content}.


\section{Subsetting JavaScript}
\label{sec:subset}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{alltt}
function Counter()\ \{
  var count = 0;
  return caja.freeze(\{
    toString: function()\ \{ 
      return "<counter: " + count + ">"; 
    \},
    incr: function()\ \{ 
      return count += 1; 
    \},
  \});
\};
\end{alltt}

\caption[A Cajita Counter.]{A Cajita Counter. Each call to \code{Counter()} 
or produces a new counter object. Access to a counter provides the authority 
to read, invoke, or enumerate its properties, all of which are simple 
functions serving the role of methods. Caja functions are implicitly Frozen; 
the returned object is explicitly Frozen; and the instance-state of the 
object---the count variable---is accessible only as encapsulated state 
captured by these pseudo-methods. As a result, a reference to a counter 
object is a proper protected capability, providing least authority to a 
shareable counter service.}
\label{fig:cajita-counter}
\end{figure}

Caja defines a subset of JavaScript both syntactically and semantically. The 
Caja translator rejects non-Caja input statically when it can. But because 
of JavaScript's dynamic nature, some of Caja's restrictions cannot be 
imposed statically, so the Caja translator translates the JavaScript it 
accepts into JavaScript with additional runtime checks. To facilitate 
development, it is easy to write a Caja program so it can run correctly 
whether it is run as a Caja program or run directly as an untranslated 
JavaScript program.

A web app (or any other JavaScript-based embedding application framework) can 
be written partially in JavaScript and partially in Caja. The web app loads 
the Caja runtime library, which is written in JavaScript, and which is 
assumed by the JavaScript output of the Caja translator. All untrusted 
scripts must be provided as Caja source code, to be verified and translated 
by the Caja translator. The translator's output is either included directly 
in the containing web page or loaded by the Caja runtime.

A loose analogy with machine and operating system architecture should help 
explain the relationships. In the analogy, the full JavaScript language 
serves the role of the machine's full instruction set. JavaScript's global 
environment serves the role of physical memory addresses. The I/O-capable 
objects provided to JavaScript by a hosting environment, such as the DOM 
objects provided by the browser, serve the role of devices.

\begin{description}

  \item[User-mode.] By a combination of static and dynamic checks, the 
  translator allows only a safe ``user-mode'' subset of JavaScript. As with 
  user-mode instructions, this subset can compute any computable function, 
  but cannot cause external effects nor sense the outside world.

  \item[Address mapping.] A package of Caja source code to be translated 
  together defines a \emph{Caja module}. All code within the same module 
  share a global environment, but distinct modules see disjoint global 
  environments. The translator maps Caja global variable references to 
  instead address module-relative fields.

  \item[Context switching.] When Caja object A has a reference to Caja 
  object B, this should enable A to invoke B's public interface but not 
  access B's internal state. A and B should both be able to defend their 
  integrity from the other's possible misbehavior.

  \item[System calls, device drivers.] When a Caja object A invokes an 
  object B written directly in JavaScript, the operations provided by B serve 
  the role of system calls. Caja protects B from A, but A is fully 
  vulnerable to B. When B is a safe wrapper around one of the host's 
  device-like objects, such as a DOM node, B also serves as a device driver.

\end{description}

A ``system call'' corresponds to a Caja object invoking a JavaScript object. 
A web app that is written entirely in JavaScript and provides many services 
to its Caja objects directly would be like a monolithic kernel. For 
compatibility with existing JavaScript apps, we support this usage pattern 
but we don't recommend it. By analogy with kernel code at the boundary with 
untrusted code, such JavaScript code needs to maintain delicate invariants 
that it is easy to get wrong.

The other extreme is analogous to a micro-kernel. The minimal necessary 
JavaScript code would be the app-neutral Caja runtime itself, and a small 
app-dependent powerbox providing device drivers and initialization. All other 
services should be Caja objects to be invoked by other Caja objects. Most 
of the logic of a web app should be structured as such Caja-based services.

\subsection{JavaScript specific problems}

Most of the above remarks would apply equally well were we starting from 
various other base languages. There are additional issues peculiar to 
JavaScript that we must deal with. Many of these issues are also software 
engineering hazards for which JavaScript programmers have developed 
defensive programming conventions. Where possible, Caja copes with these 
issues by adapting and enforcing these existing conventions.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{alltt}
function Point(x, y)\ \{
  return caja.freeze(\{
    toString: function()\ \{ 
      return "<" + x + "," + y + ">"; 
    \},
    getX: function()\ \{ return x; \},
    getY: function()\ \{ return y; \},
  \});
\};

var pt = Point(3, 5);
\end{alltt}

\caption[A Cajita Point.]{A Cajita Point. As a baseline, we first express 
this simple example in Cajita with no support for inheritance. Other 
elaborations will show how to support inheritance and various styles of

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{alltt}
function PointMixin(that, x, y)\ \{
  that.toString = function()\ \{ 
    return "<" + that.getX() + "," + 
                 that.getY() + ">"; 
  \};
  that.getX = function()\ \{ return x; \};
  that.getY = function()\ \{ return y; \};
  return that;
\}
function Point(x, y)\ \{
  return caja.freeze(PointMixin(\{\}, x, y));
\}
\end{alltt}

\caption[Cajita Inheritance.]{Cajita Inheritance. In the Cajita inheritance 
pattern, the equivalent of a non-final class is a function ending with 
``\code{Mixin}'' with \code{that} as its first parameter. The method-like 
functions can use \code{that} analogously to the use of \code{this} in full 
Caja, in order to refer to the overall object being defined. This 
``\code{*Mixin}'' function should only be called by ``subclasses'' such as 
WobblyPointMixin below. If the class is non-abstract, it should also have a 
pseudo-constructor function such as \code{Point} for making direct instances.}

  var that = PointMixin(\{\}, x, y));
  that = WobblyPointMixin(that);
  return caja.freeze(that);
\}
\end{alltt}

\caption[Cajita WobblyPointMixin.]{Cajita WobblyPointMixin. The equivalent of 
a non-final subclass is a ``\code{*Mixin}'' function with \code{that} as its 
first parameter, where the body calls \code{caja.snapshot} to make a frozen

conventional \code{super} for the other functions defined within this scope.}
\label{fig:cajita-super-wobbly-point}
\end{figure}



\begin{description}

  \item[Unconstrained Properties.] JavaScript objects contain 
  \emph{properties}, i.e., named fields holding references to other objects. 
  JavaScript specifies that some properties are constrained to be 
  \emph{Internal}, \emph{ReadOnly}, \emph{DontEnum}, or \emph{DontDelete}. 
  Such constraints would help an object protect itself from its clients, but 
  JavaScript provides no way to express these constraints in the language. 
  Instead, any object defined in JavaScript is freely mutated by any other 
  object with access to it.
  
  \item[Global environment.] All JavaScript code executing within the same 
  JavaScript engine (such as a web page or iframe) implicitly share access to 
  the same global environment. Therefore, in JavaScript, objects cannot be 
  isolated from each other.

  \item[Implicit mutable state.] Some base JavaScript objects, such as 
  \code{Array.prototype}, are implicitly reachable even without naming any 
  global variable names. Even after global environment problems are fixed, 
  the mutability of these objects would prevent isolation.

  \item[Lack of encapsulation.] To support the ``context switching'' 
  criterion explained above, objects need to be able to encapsulate their 
  private state. JavaScript does provide one such mechanism: lexical 
  variables captured by lexical closures. However, using this as the sole 
  encapsulation mechanism for object patterns conflicts with existing 
  JavaScript programming practice.

  \item[``\code{this}'' what?] JavaScript's rules for binding ``\code{this}'' 
  depend on whether a function is invoked by \emph{construction}, by 
  \emph{method call}, by \emph{function call}, or by \emph{reflection}. If a 
  function written to be called in one way is instead called in another way, 
  its ``\code{this}'' might be rebound to a different object or even to the 
  global environment.

  \item[Foreign \code{for}/\code{in} loops.] JavaScript's 
  \code{for}/\code{in} loop enumerates the names of all an object's 
  properties, whether inherited or not, unless the property is DontEnum, 
  which the JavaScript programmer has no way to express. As a result, some of 
  these names need to be skipped by the loop body. Every JavaScript coding 
  style invents its own defensive pattern of additional tests to skip 
  unwanted property names.
    
  \item[Weak static analysis.] Although Caja is less dynamic than JavaScript, 
  we still assume that it is impractical to perform any interesting analysis, 
  such as type inference, both statically and safely. As a result, Caja's 
  static restrictions can only enforce simple syntactic rules. Remaining 
  restrictions must be enforced by runtime checks.
  
  \item[Fast path.] For the micro-kernel approach to be attractive, Caja's 
  extra runtime checks must not cost too much. Frequent operations, such as 
  property access using ``.'' must run close to full speed.
  
  \item[Uncontrolled language growth.] The ES3 spec allows one to add new 
  dangerous properties to core objects while claiming ES3 compatibility. 
  JavaScript language implementors, platform providers, and standards 
  committees make use of this freedom with unpredictable results. For 
  example, some JavaScript implementations have added dangerous properties, 
  like \code{eval}, to core objects, like \code{Object.prototype}. A safe 
  subset must deny access to these additional unknown properties. But since 
  these new properties are often DontEnum, there isn't even a reliable way to 
  detect them.
  
  \item[Browser compatibility.] Web content must work on widely deployed 
  browsers whether on not these browsers strictly conform to the relevant 
  standards. At the time of this writing, the plausible baseline platform is 
  the intersection of ES3, Firefox 1.5, Internet Explorer 6, Opera 8.5, 
  Safari 3, and their successors. Fortunately, these browsers do conform 
  quite closely to ES3. Later versions of Caja may specify larger subsets of 
  ES3.
  
  \item[Silent errors.] In JavaScript, various operations, such as setting a 
  ReadOnly property, fail silently rather than throwing an error. Program 
  logic then proceeds along normal control flow paths premised on the 
  assumption that these operations succeeded, leading to inconsistency. To 
  program defensively in the face of this hazard, every assignment would be 
  followed by a ``\emph{did it really happen?}'' test. This would render 
  programs unreadable and unmaintainable. Where practical, Caja deviates from 
  standard JavaScript by throwing an exception rather than failing silently.
  
  \item[Feature testing.] The JavaScript \emph{feature testing} pattern 
  relies on a failed attempt to read a property returning \code{undefined} 
  rather than throwing an exception. Since, in this case, the program 
  naturally notices the problem anyway, Caja does not turn this case into a 
  thrown exception.
    
\end{description}

This last point about ``Silent errors'' is another reason to avoid the 
monolithic kernel approach. Web apps in untranslated JavaScript are 
vulnerable to any malicious active content that finds a way to provoke a 
silent error and exploit the resulting inconsistency.

Caja is only a subset of JavaScript in a limited sense: While a Caja program 
has not explicitly indicated a failure, it executes within JavaScript's 
semantics. By \emph{indicate a failure}, we mean either throwing an exception 
or returning \code{undefined} for a property read. 

\section{Cajita Specification}
\label{sec:cajita-spec}


Most of the complexity of Caja is needed to defend against JavaScript's rules 
regarding the binding of ``\code{this}''. The subset of Caja without 
``\code{this}'' is a perfectly reasonable and expressive programming 
language. Caja supports ``\code{this}'' in order to ease the porting of old 
code. For new code, we recommend sticking to the thisless subset of Caja, 
which we refer to as \emph{Cajita}, the diminutive, meaning ``small box''. 
(The Caja translator may eventually provide a switch to enforce that a 
translated program is within Cajita.)

\end{figure}


\subsection{Definitions}

To explain the restrictions Cajita imposes, we need some definitions.

\begin{description}

  \item[JSON Container.] An object whose prototype's ``\code{constructor}'' 
  property is \code{Array} or \code{Object}, i.e., under normal conditions, 
  an object inheriting directly from \code{Array.prototype} or 
  \code{Object.prototype}. JSON containers are normally created using the
  \code{[\ldots]} or \code{\{\ldots\}} syntaxes.

  \item[Simple functions.] A function whose body does not mention 
  ``\code{this}'' is a \emph{simple function}. A simple function can be 
  either named or anonymous. A simple function can be invoked \emph{as a 
  function} (\code{foo(a\ldots)}), \emph{as a method} 
  (\code{foo.id(a\ldots)}), or \emph{as a constructor} (\code{new 
  Foo(a\ldots)}). Simple functions are first class---they can be stored in
  variables and passed around freely, just like any other value.
  
  \item[Frozen.] If an object is \emph{Frozen}, any attempt to directly 
  assign to its properties, add new properties to it, or delete its 
  properties causes an exception to be thrown. Frozen is a shallow 
  restriction: Frozen objects can retain and provide non-Frozen objects. 
  (Imagine a frozen surface covering a liquid lake.) Once initialized, all 
  Caja functions---simple functions, constructors, and methods---are 
  implicitly frozen, as are constructor prototypes. The Caja runtime library 
  additionally provides an explicit operation for freezing an object: 
  ``\code{caja.freeze(obj)}''.
  
  \item[Immutable.] If an object is \emph{Immutable}, then it is Frozen, and 
  all objects it has access to are themselves Immutable. Shared access to an 
  Immutable object does not provide a communication channel, and so does not 
  endanger isolation. With the exception of \code{Math.random} and 
  \code{Date}, all objects that are globally or implicitly accessible to all 
  Caja programs are Immutable. We discuss these exceptions below.  

\end{description}

\subsection{Static restrictions}

Any source code statically accepted by the Caja translator is \emph{verified 
Caja program text}. The presence of the following syntactic elements causes 
an alleged Caja program text to instead be statically rejected.

\begin{description}

    \item[Stable language.] Virtually any input which should be statically 
    rejected by ES3 is forbidden, even if it would be allowed by a target 
    browser or later JavaScript specifications. This includes any use of 
    keywords reserved in ES3. But we reserve the right to include 
    \emph{de-facto extensions} to ES3 as explained below.
    
    \item[De-facto extensions.] As we identify widely supported extensions of 
    ES3 that we can accept as input, but still translate to conforming 
    EcmaScript on output, we may add these to Caja. For example, we are 
    currently considering allowing backslash as a line continuation 
    character, since this is allowed by virtually all JavaScript 
    implementations and can be trivially translated to correct ES3.

    \item[Without ``\code{with}''.] The ``\code{with}'' keyword is forbidden. 
    Because of the scope confusion it causes, ``\code{with}'' is a widely 
    hated and avoided feature that would be a lot of trouble to support 
    safely.

    \item[Beware unicode.] Non-Latin-1 characters are forbidden for now in 
    source text outside of string literals. Some of these create parsing 
    problems on some widely deployed JavaScript platforms. Prohibiting these 
    protects against some char-encoding attacks. We expect to relax this 
    restriction once we know how to do so safely.

    \item[Forbidden names.] An identifier ending with a double underscore is 
    forbidden, either as a variable name or a property name. We reserve the 
    triple underscore for use by the Caja translator output and the Caja 
    runtime code. Firefox reserves use of the double underscore for itself.
    
    \item[RegExp syntax.] In JavaScript implementations, the pattern syntax 
    is often optimized into a static object with mutable state, violating 
    isolation. Caja translates the \code{/pattern/} syntax to \code{new 
    RegExp("pattern")}.
    
    \item[Caja features absent from Cajita.] See section~\ref{sec:caja-spec} 
    for the rules governing the ``\code{this}'' keyword, identifiers ending 
    in a single underscore, and the ``\code{new}'' keyword.
        
\end{description}

\subsection{Outer environment restrictions}

In JavaScript, all code loaded into the same JavaScript execution environment 
shares a common mutable global environment. To avoid confusion, we refer to 
the corresponding concept in Caja as the \emph{outer environment}. The Caja 
outer environment comes in two layers:

Caja's \emph{shared outer environment} contains the subset of the standard 
ES3 global environment that we deem to be safe. This includes all the objects 
and properties defined by that standard, with the following caveats. Unless 
stated otherwise, all the objects in this outer environment are transitively 
immutable, so that they provide no ambient authority to objects defined 
within this environment. The shared outer environment itself is frozen.

Each instantiation of a Caja module is a separate plugin. Each plugin 
executes with a new \emph{per-plugin outer environment} which is mutable and 
inherits from Caja's shared outer environment. Therefore, all objects within 
the same plugin can implicitly communicate and interfere with each other. 
However, \emph{claim: two separate plugins, even if they instantiate the same 
module, are isolated from each other.}

\end{figure}

\begin{description}

    \item[eval] The Caja global environment has no ``\code{eval}'' function. 
    Instead, the ``\code{Caja.eval}'' method will evaluate Caja source code 
    with an explicitly provided set of variable bindings to serve as its 
    initial global environment, as explained below.
    
    \item[Function] The JavaScript \code{Function} constructor is absent from 
    the default Caja outer environment, and must not be available in Caja.

    Unfortunately, \code{Function} is unsafe even when invoked as a normal 
    function, and we're currently hoping to stop protecting normal function 
    calls with a runtime check. \emph{Claim: Even without the runtime check 
    on normal function calls, the rest of the restrictions in this document 
    together make \code{Function} uncreachable from Caja programs.}
    
    \item[function.constructor] The JavaScript \code{constructor} property of 
    functions is absent from Caja.

    \item[new Date()] In JavaScript, ``\code{new Date()}''  gives ambient 
    access to the current date and time, in violation of object-capability 
    rules as well as dependency injection discipline. \code{Date} is 
    therefore a member of the global environment which is not actually 
    immutable. Further, this ambient access to the current time provides a 
    timing channel, further impeding any attempts to stem the leakage of bits 
    over covert channels. Nevertheless, despite these concerns, because it 
    provides only a read-only channel for sensing the world, Caja provides 
    the JavaScript \code{Date} constructor to Caja programs.

    \item[Math.random()] The JavaScript \code{Math.random} method is not even 
    read-only. The ES3 standard places no obligations regarding quality of the
    randomness produced. In particular, an implementation could conform to ES3
    and still leak to a given caller of \code{Math.random()} the ability to
    infer how many previous times it had been called. Nevertheless, Caja
    provides the JavaScript \code{Math.random} method to Caja programs. We
    recommend that JavaScript platform providers provide good enough
    randomness that this method doesn't serve as an information channel
    between otherwise-isolated plugins.

\subsection{Definitions}

To explain the restrictions Caja imposes on JavaScript, we need some
additional definitions. 

\begin{description}

  \item[Constructed object.] An object defined by Caja code that's not a 
  JSON container and not a function must have been constructed by calling 
  ``\code{new}'' on a consructor other than \code{Array} or \code{Object}. 
  Constructed objects and the ``\code{new}'' keyword are absent from Cajita.

  \item[Constructors.] A named function whose body mentions ``\code{this}'' 
  is a \emph{constructor}. A constructor can only be invoked by construction, 
  i.e., by a call using the ``\code{new}'' keyword. To enforce this, 
  constructors are not \emph{first class values}. A constructor definition 
  and a constructor name can only appear in certain static contexts 
  enumerated below, in order to ensure that the constructor value does not 
  escape. Constructors are absent from Cajita.
    
  \item[Methods.] An anonymous function whose body mentions ``\code{this}'' 
  is a \emph{method}. A method definition may only appear in prototype 
  property initializations. To avoid the confusions regarding 
  ``\code{this}'', Caja methods are also not first class. A property holding 
  a method is \emph{call only}, it can be called but not read. Methods are 
  absent from Cajita.

\end{description}


\subsection{Static restrictions}

Any source code statically accepted by the Caja translator is \emph{verified 
Caja program text}. The presence of the following syntactic elements causes 
an alleged Caja program text to instead be statically rejected.

\begin{description}

    \item[Internal properties.] An identifier ending in a single underscore 
    may be used only to name Internal properties. It may appear only after a 
    ``\code{this.}''.

\end{description}

Although constructors are normally frozen and the ``\code{prototype}'' 
property of functions is generally not settable, we allow at least the 
patterns shown in Figures~\ref{fig:use-proto} and~\ref{fig:shorthand} for 
declaring a constructor, initializing it, and initializing its prototype. 
Figures~\ref{fig:generic-point} and~\ref{fig:brief-point} show a familiar 
example expressed in these patterns.

The first argument to ``\code{Caja.def}'' may be the prototype only of a 
fresh definition of F. None of these initialization may make any other use of 
F or F.prototype. All initialization of F and its prototype will therefore 
precede any use of F. This means, in effect, that the assignments above can 
be considered declarative initializations rather than mutations. The mention 
of ``\code{Point}'' within the ``\code{add}'' method is not considered a 
too-early usage of ``\code{Point}'' since it occurs only within a method body 
that cannot be executed too early.

Claim: \emph{No Caja program can cause an observable mutation of an object
Caja considers frozen.}

\caption[Translating Callers and Callees]{Translating Callers and Callees.
A translated Caja module can be loaded/evaled once, creating an anonymous
plugin-maker function. Each time the plugin-maker representing a module is
called, it makes a new plugin. Unless their creator puts them in contact, even
plugins made by the same plugin-maker are isolated from each other. A function
that falls off the end is rewritten to return \code{undefined} explicitly, in
case it is called as a constructor.}
