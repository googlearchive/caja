<h1>Template Compilers</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a> provides a way to
sandbox javascript.  It uses a variety of mechanisms to limit the authority
scripts have running in a browser by partitioning a document into a multiple
virtual documents.

<p><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/innerhtml.html">Benchmarks</a> show
that using DOM manipulation to create a UI on the browser is slow even on
recently released browsers:
<blockquote>
  The most obvious conclusion of these tests is that innerHTML is
  faster than "real" W3C DOM methods in all browsers. The W3C DOM
  table methods are slow to very slow, especially in Explorer.
</blockquote>

<p>While there are a number of templating languages that run in-browser
(including browser built-ins like <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/"
>XSL</a>, languages that compile to javascript like
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gxp/wiki/WhyGxp">GXP</a>, javascript only
solutions like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/"
>JSTemplates</a>, and others), there is no consensus on how to do templating on
the browser.  The wide use of systems like FBML, YML, and OSML amongst gadget
authors show that templating languages are used.

<p>Many of these existing templating languages are widely tied to app-hosting
services (like Facebook and FBML) but there are a number of non-proprietary
in-browser templating languages.

<p>Some of these templating languages use sensible defaults to mitigate XSS and
other injection problems, but none of them address malicious template authors.

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>A mechanism to allow HTML templating schemes like Soy, OpenSocial
Templates, client-side GXP, XSL, and others to plug into a sandboxed
web application framework like Caja without compromising the security
properties of the sandbox even against malicious developers.

<p>It is a goal to support a large part of a range of templating languages
including dynamic attribute values, dynamic textual content, conditional and
repeated evaluation, and decomposition of large templates into smaller ones.
Dynamic tag names, such as <code>&lt;h$number&gt;</code> is a nice-to-have.

<p>It is a goal for templates to be compiled to efficient javascript
functions.  Since there is a 10x-100x performance penalty for DOM manipulation
over parsing <code>innerHTML</code> it is a goal for templates to not incur
a performance penalty for the portions that can be statically verified safe
 &mdash; if a template contains a lot of boilerplate HTML with one dynamic
substitution then the performance of the template should approach the
performance of the browser's HTML parser as the amount of boilerplate
&rarr; &#8734;.

<p>It is a goal to support a variety of security policies, including
ones that limit which URLs can be linked to, that sandbox handler
scripts, that restrict navigation of the current window, etc.  It is
not a goal to prevent all quoting confusion, but it is a goal to
prevent injected code from invoking any function not explicitly
exported from a caja module for use by event handlers.

<p>It is not a goal to support arbitrary policies and we restrict
policies to those which can be specified in terms of whitelists of
elements, attributes, and regular grammar constraints on HTML
attributes and CSS properties.  Supporting trusted-path is
nice-to-have but is not a goal.

<p>It is goal for a cajoled HTML page to be compilable to a zero-argument
template once interleaved script blocks have been removed in a way that
lets us track which portions need to be visible to each script block.

<p>It is a non-goal to support the exact semantics of languages like PHP that
are specified in terms of string interpolation.

<p>It is a non-goal to support those portions of templating languages that
self-evaluate (i.e. treat an input as a string of the template language),
or that allow expressions to introspect over a partially built output.

<p>It is a non-goal to allow production of arbitrary well-formedness HTML.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<img src="TemplateCompiler.png" alt="Pipeline"
 style="float: left; margin-left: -3px; margin-right: 3px">
<p>We first define an intermediate language, IHTML, that a template can be
compiled to.  Template language designers can implement this conversion,
and the system does not depend on any aspect of this conversion to
maintain security properties so they need not have a background in security.
<pre class="prettyprint"
>&lt;template name="helloPlanets">&gt;
  <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b>
    &lt;for-each name="planet" in="planets"&gt;
      <b>&lt;li&gt;</b>
        <b>Hello </b>$planet
      <b>&lt;/li&gt;</b>
    &lt;/for-each&gt;
  <b>&lt;/ul&gt;</b>
&lt;/template&gt;</pre>
might compile to
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:template name="helloPlanets" formals="planet"&gt;
  <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b>
    &lt;ihtml:do vars="planet,i" init="i=0,true" while="i &lt; planets.length"
     step="++i"&gt;
      &lt;ihtml:template name="loopbody0" formals="planet"&gt;
        <b>&lt;li&gt;</b>
          <b>Hello </b>&lt;ihtml:dynamic pcdata="planet"/&gt;
        <b>&lt;/li&gt;</b>
      &lt;/ihtml:template&gt;
      &lt;ihtml:call ihtml:template="loopbody0" planet="planet"/&gt;
    &lt;/ihtml:do&gt;
  <b>&lt;/ul&gt;</b>
&lt;ihtml:template&gt;</pre>

<p>The template compiler then applies
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/CajaWhitelists">HTML and CSS
schemas</a> to the IHTML parse tree.  The schemas may add/remove/normalize HTML
elements, HTML attributes, and CSS properties.  IHTML nodes are ignored entirely
by the schemas, so that once schemas have been successfully applied the
non-IHTML portion is known to be a safe quantity.

<p>IHTML nodes contain javascript and that is run through a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Javascript sandboxer</a>
which will complain if any expressions have unexpected free variables, and
may add runtime checks.  This same sandboxer is typically used to sanitize
<code>onclick</code> attributes and the like.

<p>Once validation is done, the IHTML&rarr;JS compiler converts the IHTML tree
to a javascript function.  This stage may be implemented in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li>Composing a string from parts as outlined under detailed design.</li>
<li>Using <code>innerHTML</code> to parse the static bit, duplicating
    repeated sections, and walking the tree to inject dynamic bits at the
    right place.
</ul>
but they all have to vet dynamic values.  For each
<code>&lt;ihtml:dynamic&gt;</code> bit they have to apply a policy:
<ul>
<li>For dynamic element names, they have to whitelist the name, and check
    whether it can appear in its parent.
<li>For dynamic attribute names, they have to whitelist, and vet the value.
<li>For dynamic attribute values, they have to check the client-side
    schema against the (element name, attribute name) pair, and possibly
    rewrite or reject the value.
<li>For dynamic text, they need to check that the containing tag is
    allowed to contain dynamic text, and possibly choose the right
    (PCDATA vs RCDATA vs CDATA) escaping convention.
</ul>

<p>The compiled function is now ready to be shipped to the client.  It
takes values of a form specified by the template compiler, so this scheme
is agnostic as to whether templates take a javascript value as input, an
XML document, or a channel to remote content as input.
The return convention is independent of the templating language.
Possible return conventions include:
<ul>
<li>return a value that is trademarked as known safe HTML which
    can be injected into any element that accepts PCDATA content.
<li>as 1, but attach DHTML behaviors extracted from <code>script</code>
    elements in the input as promises to be executed when the output
    is actually attached to the live DOM.
<li>output an object that encapsulates both the string of static HTML, and
    a set of dynamics : descriptions of how to find nodes, which dynamic
    part to specify, and the appropriate sanitizer.
    This return convention would allow us to represent a gadget as
    a zero-argument template, and could be wrapped to simply implement
    return convention (1) or (2).
<li>as another approach but continuation passing style.
</ul>


<p>There are a variety of ways applications could display a template output
created by untrusted code, but one way is to provide a privileged channel
that checks the trademark on its input, and if it passes, injects it into
a DOM node.  DOMita virtualizes <code>HTMLElement.innerHTML</code> this way.


<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

<h3>IHTML</h3>
<p>IHTML is an abstract template language that real template languages can be
compiled to.  It has very few constructs so is easy to reason about, but is
not meant to be written by humans.

<p>Although all dynamic content and control flow decisions are specified
as javascript expressions, templates can use any expression language
that can be translated to javascript.

<p>One of the properties that make it easy to reason about is that,
for each node, we have a very good bound on the set of node-types
contributed to the output by that node &mdash; an HTML element, text
node, or attribute contributes its type, an <code>ihtml:do</code>
element contributes the union of its body and its alternative and a
template call contributes the union of the elements in the template
body.  Since all template calls are dispatched statically, we can
preserve containment relationships specified in the HTML schema.

<p>IHTML adds five elements to HTML that can appear anywhere an element can
appear.

<h4>Template definition : <code>ihtml:template</code></h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:template name="foo" formals="bar,baz"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Body that uses bar and baz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ihtml:template&gt;
</pre>

<p>Defines a template and its signature.  The top level element in an
IHTML doc produced by a template compiler must by of this type.</p>
<p>The required <code>name</code> attribute is a safe identifier.
<p>The required <code>formals</code> attribute is a comma separated list of
distinct safe identifiers.  An identifier may not be both a name and a formal
for the same <code>ihtml:template</code>.

<p>An <code>ihtml:template</code> is said to be <a id="reentrant">reentrant</a>
iff it is on a loop in a graph with a node for each template in the compilation
unit and an edge for each <code>ihtml:call</code> from the closest containing
<code>ihtml:template</code> to the called template.  This graph has to be
computed post <a href="#alpha-renaming">alpha renaming</a>.

<h4>Template invocation : <code>ihtml:call</code></h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:call ihtml:template="foo" bar="1" baz="2"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Invokes a template substituting the DOM produced by the template into.
A template that is declared inside another template is assumed to inherit
all the state of the outer.  Inner templates are not first-class so there
is no danger of a template being called after the scope in which it's
declared has been left.
<p>The required <code>ihtml:template</code> attribute is a safe identifier and
specifies the template to call.  If it is the name of an inner template
then that one is used.  Otherwise, it must be the name of a top-level
template in the same compilation unit.
<p>All other attributes are javascript expressions that are mapped to
identifiers in the called template's <code>formals</code> list.
The set of actual attributes in the <code>ihtml:call</code> must match
the set of formals in the called template.
<p><code>ihtml:call</code> elements cannot appear inside an element that
allows CDATA content.  Template compiler implementors should translate
<code>XMP</code>, <code>LISTING</code>, and <code>PLAINTEXT</code>
elements to <code>PRE</code> tags if those need to be supported.

<h4>Block scoping, repetition and conditional evaluation
 : <code>ihtml:do</code> and <code>ihtml:else</code></h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:do
 vars="aLocalVariableName,another"
 init="aBooleanExpression()"
 while="aBooleanExpression()"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Evaluated until the while attribute evaluates to falsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ihtml:else/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Evaluated once if init is initially falsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ihtml:do&gt;
</pre>
 
<p>Introduces a block scope, and possibly repeatedly evaluates its body.
<p>The optional <code>vars</code> attribute specifies a set of variables
that enter scope when the <code>ihtml:do</code> is entered, and which
are cleaned up when it is exited.
<p>The optional <code>init</code> attribute is a javascript expression
that is executed before control enters the <code>ihtml:do</code>'s body.
If the result is truthy then control passes to the <code>while</code> attribute,
otherwise control passes to the alternate as described below.
This can be used to initialize <code>vars</code> as in
<code class="prettyprint">a = 1, b = 2, true</code>.
<p>The required <code>while</code> attribute is a javascript expression.
The body is evaluated as long as the <code>while</code> attribute's result is
truthy.
<p>The <code>ihtml:do</code> may contain a single <code>ihtml:else</code>
element.  If it does, its body is every child before the
<code>ihtml:else</code> and its alternate is every child after.
Otherwise the body is every child, and the alternate is the empty node list.

<h4>Dynamic content : <code>ihtml:dynamic</code></h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;a&gt;
  &lt;!-- A link with a dynamic URL --&gt;
  &lt;ihtml:dynamic attribute="['href', myUrl]" if="myUrl !== null"/&gt;
  Link Text
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>Uses javascript to specify changes to the containing HTML element.
<p>This element must have exactly one of the following attributes:
<ul>
  <li><code>pcdata</code> : a javascript expression that is evaluated as a
      string, escaped using PCDATA escaping contentions and added as a text
      node at the place where the <code>ihtml:dynamic</code> element appears.
      It is an error for this type of dynamic element to appear in a node that
      cannot take PCDATA, though we make an exception for <code>TEXTAREA</code>
      elements since RCDATA is more restrictive than PCDATA.
  <li><code>attribute</code> : a javascript expression that evaluates to a
      <code class="prettyprint">[attributeName, attributeValue]</code> pair.
  <li><code>tagName</code> : a javascript expression that evaluates to a
      string containing a lower-case HTML 4 element name.
      It must appear as a child of <code>SPAN</code>, <code>DIV</code>,
      <code>TBODY</code>, or <code>TD</code> element, and will cause the
      containing element to be replaced with one with the given name containing
      the same content and same specified attributes.
      <br>
      The name must be that of an element that can appear wherever the
      original can.  E.g., any inline element may replace a SPAN, any block
      element may replace a DIV, a TH may replace a TD, and a THEAD or TFOOT
      may replace a TBODY.
</ul>
<p>And it may have an <code>if</code> attribute which is a javascript expression
that is evaluated before the other attributes.  If it evaluates to falsey, then
the no other javascript expressions are evaluated, and the current evaluation
has no effect on the output.  If the attribute is not present, its value
defaults to <code>true</code>.

<h4>Text Localization : <code>ihtml:message</code></h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:message name="result_index"
 description="The index of the current result in the result list"&gt;
  Result &lt;b&gt;&lt;ihtml:ph name="start"/&gt;&lt;ihtml:dynamic text=" i + 1 "/&gt;&lt;ihtml:eph/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  of &lt;b&gt;&lt;ihtml:ph name="end"/&gt;&lt;ihtml:dynamic text=" n "/&gt;&lt;ihtml:eph/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/ihtml:message&gt;
</pre>
Marks a passage of human readable text.  Cannot contain other
<code>ihtml:{message,def,do,call}</code> elements outside of a
<code>ihtml:ph</code>, <code>ihtml:eph</code> pair.

<p>This element must have a <code>name</code> attribute which is a safe
identifier and may contain matched pairs of <code>ihtml:ph</code> and
<code>ihtml:eph</code> elements, as shown above, which mark the beginning
and end of a named placeholder respectively.

<p>It is the responsibility of the template compiler to ensure that
placeholders can be re-ordered without changing the semantics of the
template.

<h4>Debugging Info in IHTML</h4>
<p>Template implementors should use a lexer&amp;|parser that preserves source
file position info, and copy that over to the IHTML tree so that the schema
can report locations of items that don't validate.  File positions must be
attached to every node -- even <code>ihtml:dynamic</code> since in debug
mode, dynamic sanitization failures will emit log messages to the browser
console.

<h3>I18N &amp; L10N</h3>
<p>This template scheme provides no explicit mechanism for
internationalization(<a href="#auto-rtl">*</a>),
though it does provide for text localization (L10N).  A templating language
that provides syntactic support for I18N should use javascript libraries to
provide formatting.

<p>Text localization is almost orthogonal to generic templating &mdash;
a template compiler could implement it's own message extraction and
substitution scheme, but app hosting services can help application authors by
automating parts of the message extraction and translation workflow.
A hosting service can run the template compiler stage by itself on a
template to produce a message bundle which can then be forwarded to
translators.  Text localization, though orthogonal, is one of the features
that if supported at the generic templating, will lower the cost for hosting
services to experiment with different templating schemes.

<p>Unlike server-side text-localization, on the browser, we only need to
deal with a single locale: that of the user.  So we take a message bundle,
and rewrite the IHTML document to function per-locale.
This is more efficient, since the client need not maintain mappings
per-locale, and need not do redundant lookups or string concatenations.
It is also more secure since we have the localized strings in context
before we attempt to do validation.

<p>A message bundle is a mapping from message IDs to strings with
placeholders like a python substitution string
<code>"Push &lt;button&gt;%(button_text)s&lt;/button&gt; to send mail to %(recipient)."</code>
where the content is HTML.

<p>The text localizer walks over the IHTML tree replacing
<code>ihtml:msg</code>, <code>ihtml:ph</code>, and
<code>ihtml:eph</code> elements with the appropriate message as in
<table summary="before and after text localization">
<tr valign="middle">
<td><pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ihtml:message name="greeting"&gt;
  Hello
  &lt;ihtml:ph name="planet"/&gt;
    &lt;ihtml:dynamic text="planet"/&gt;
  &lt;ihtml:eph/&gt;!
&lt;/ihtml:message&gt;
</pre></td>
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td>Greeting in English: <code>"Hello %(planet)s!"</code>
<br>Greeting in Spanish: <code>"&#xA1;Ola %(planet)s!"</code>
<br>Locale: es
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&#xA1;Ola &lt;ihtml:dynamic text="planet"/&gt;!
</pre></td>
</table>
by doing the following:
<ul>
  <li>Extract all placeholders (between
    <code class="prettyprint">&lt;ihtml:ph name="&hellip;"/&gt;&hellip;&lt;ihtml:eph/&gt;</code>)
    into a map indexed by the <code>ihtml:ph</code>s' name attributes.
    If a name is reused, report an error.
  <li>Lookup the message matching the <code>ihtml:message</code>'s
    <code>name</code> attribute.
  <li>If the set of placeholder names in the <code>ihtml:message</code> is
    different from that in the message bundle message, report an error.
  <li>Parse the message bundle message to a document fragment, and replace
    all occurrences of <code>%(&lt;safe-identifier&gt;)s</code> in a text node
    with the corresponding placeholder extracted in step 1, and replace all
    occurrences of the string <code>"%%"</code> in a text node with
    <code>"%"</code>.
  <li>Replace the <code>ihtml:message</code> element with the document
    fragment's children.
</ul>

<p>Templating languages that don't explicitly mark messages, or don't
explicitly name messages can make a best effort to identify message boundaries
and use string hashing to generate a message id.

<h3>CSS &amp; HTML Schemas</h3>
<p>CSS and HTML schemas are already applied to Cajoled gadgets, so this
document does not cover the details of either server or client-side schema
based validation.
<p>This design does rely on schema validation to produce an IHTML tree
that is valid, safe HTML if all inner <code>ihtml:template</code>
elements were removed, all <code>ihtml:call</code> were replaced with
their templates content (or nothing if recursion would result), all
<code>ihtml:do</code> were replaced with either their body or
alternate, and all other <code>ihtml:</code> elements were replaced
with their children.
<p>We also assume that 

<h3>Javascript sandboxing</h3>
<p>Some of the custom <code>ihtml:</code> elements contain attributes that are
javascript expressions.
Sandboxing javascript in IHTML requires two steps &mdash; one to make sure
that the scoping of variables defined in <code>ihtml:do</code> and
<code>ihtml:template</code> are correct, and the second to sandbox those
expressions.

<p>The first step is to do an alpha-renaming to prevent namespace
collisions and preserve the block scoping properties of the
<code>ihtml:do</code> and <code>ihtml:template</code> constructs.
This alpha renaming affects template names as well.
Template names are treated as in a distinct namespace from formal
parameters and locals.  For security we rely on the alpha-renaming to
not introduce unsafe-identifiers since it might mask the output
buffer, and the sanitizer functions.  We do not rely on the
alpha-renaming to be correct for security to hold.

<h4 id="alpha-renaming">Alpha renaming</h4>
<p>An alpha renaming is a remapping of identifiers which ensures that
no use of an identifier in a scope masks a use of an identifier in an
outer scope.  We do an alpha-renaming because javascript is not a
block scoped language, but the <code>ihtml:template</code> and
<code>ihtml:do</code> constructs specify block scoping.

<p>After an alpha it becomes trivial to inline <code>ihtml:call</code>s
which is important since we provide only one operation that can decompose
the input.  Most looping constructs will need both a 

<p>We define a <code>Renaming</code> class,
<pre class="prettyprint">
final class Renaming {
  Renaming parent;
  Iterator&lt;String&gt; nameGenerator;
  // maps names in original source to
  Map&lt;String, VarInfo&gt; vars = new HashMap&lt;String;, VarInfo&gt;;

  static final class VarInfo {
    final String newName;
    final FilePosition declaredAt;
    final boolean isTemplate;
  }

  /**
   * @param nameGenerator an infinite iterator that returns safe identifiers
   *    that do not match any identifier used in javascript expressions attached
   *    to IHTML nodes, and that never returns the same String twice.
   */
  Renaming(Iterator&lt;String&gt; nameGenerator) {
    this.nameGenerator = nameGenerator;
  }

  Renaming subScope() {
    Renaming subScope = new Renaming(this);
    subScope.parent = this;
    return subScope;
  }

  void declare(String originalName, FilePosition declarationSite,
               boolean isTemplate) {
    if (vars.contains(originalName)) { throw &hellip; }
    vars.put(originalName,
             new VarInfo(nameGenerator.next(), declarationSite, isTemplate));
  }

  private VarInfo lookup(String originalName, boolean isTemplate) {
    for (Renaming r = this; r != null; r = r.parent) {
      VarInfo vi = vars.get(originalName);
      if (vi != null &amp;&amp; vi.isTemplate == isTemplate) { return vi; }
    }
    return null;
  }

  VarInfo lookupVar(String originalName) {
    return lookup(originalName, false);
  }

  VarInfo lookupTemplate(String originalName) {
    return lookup(originalName, false);
  }

  Iterable&lt;VarInfo&gt; newVarNames() {
    return Iterables.filter(vars.values(), new Predicate&lt;VarInfo&gt;() {
      public boolean apply(VarInfo vi) { return !vi.isTemplate; }
    });
  }
}</pre>

<p>We create a blank <code>Renaming</code> instance which will collect all
top-level template names, and recursively walk the DOM.  We also create an
empty set of variables to import.

<p>We invoke <code>Renaming.subScope()</code> to create a new scope for each
<code>ihtml:template</code> and <code>ihtml:do</code> element we reach.
For the former, we <code>declare()</code> the template name in the super-scope,
and the <code>formals</code> in the sub-scope.  For the latter, we declare the
<code>vars</code> in the sub-scope.

<p>After attaching the appropriate scope to a node, we check all its javascript
expressions and rename their free variables using the alpha renaming.  If the
<code>lookup</code> method returns null then one of the expressions has a
free variables, add it to the import set.

<p>After this step completes, we know that the javascript expressions are
encapsulated into their appropriate scopes.

<h4>Sandboxing JS Expressions</h4>
<p>The cajoler is detailed elsewhere, and so will not be described here.
<p>This design relies on the cajoler to effectively sandbox malicious code,
and requires the cajoler to allow it to introduce safe identifiers into scope.
<p>Every javascript expression must contain only free variables that
are a formal template parameter declared in an enclosing
<code>ihtml:template</code> or a variable declared in an enclosing
<code>ihtml:do</code>'s <code>vars</code> attribute.  If a template
implementor wishes to avoid declarations, they should examine the
javascript they generate to find the set of free variables and add
declarations at the appropriate level.

<h3>IHTML &rarr; JS Compiler</h3>
<p>The IHTML&rarr;JS compiler produces a javascript function.  It accepts a set
of IHTML parse trees and applies the transform described below to produce an
object with methods named after the template which can be loaded into
the local scope using the usual javascript mixin operation.
The names of the top level templates must be distinct.

<h4>Compilation</h4>
<p>Fist, the compiler creates empty functions for all top-level templates
and all re-entrant inner templates.  The function signatures look like
<code class="prettyprint">function <i>&lt;alphaName&gt;</i>(out__, <i>&lt;formal0&gt;</i>, &hellip;) { var tn___, as___, ap___; &hellip; }</code>.
The <code>out__</code> parameter is an array that will accumulate chunks of
HTML that will be joined together later.  The <code>tn___</code> is a convenient
way to propagate tag names to attribute sanitizers, and <code>as___</code>
helps avoids duplicate attributes.

<p>Second, the compiler recursively applies the algorithm described below to
turn the bodies of the templates for which we generated signatures into
function bodies.

<p>Finally, we create an envelope for the compilation unit which guarantees
that templates have a reliable path to call one another, and which produces
functions that can be loaded into the scope where the templates are needed.

<h4>Recursive transform</h4>
<p>The transforms below take IHTML nodes and translate them into javascript.
They use javascript quasiliterals which are detailed elsewhere, and the
operation <code>emitHtmlChunk(b, e)</code> which works as follows:
<ul>
<li>Given a block b that is known to produce only strings of well-formed
  HTML on <code>out___</code> that can be concatenated with the expression e to
  produce a well-formed string of HTML,
<li>If b does not end with a statement like <code>out___.push(&hellip;);</code>
  add a statement <code>out___.push();</code>
<li>If e is a string literal and the last actual parameter to the last
  statement is a string literal, replace the last actual with the
  concatenation of it and e.
<li>else add e to the actual parameter list of the last statement.
</ul>

<p>When an <code>ihtml:template</code> is seen, skip it without recursing.</p>

<p>When an <code>ihtml:call</code> is seen, look up the corresponding
<code>ihtml:template</code> element using the alpha name of its
<code>ihtml:template</code> attribute.
If it is a non-reentrant inner template, inline its body as in
<pre class="prettyprint">
// Below a4, a5 are formal parameters, and (3, "hello") are actual parameters.
{
  // TODO: This is glossing over details.  We should preserve the order of
  // side-effects as specified in the ihtml:call's attribute order.
  var a4 = 3, a5 = "hello";
  &lt;body&gt;
  // Could clean up a4, a5 here.
}
</pre>
This inlining is valid because the alpha-renaming done earlier makes namespace
collision impossible, and because inner templates don't return a value or
transfer control non-locally.
<p>
Otherwise, if the call is to a top-level or reentrant template, then expand as
in
<pre class="prettyprint">
// a0 is the template names, and (3, "hello") are the actual parameters.
// TODO: We may need to assign parameters to temporaries to preserve order of
// side-effects as specified in the ihtml:call's attribute order.
// We pass out___ so the called template uses the same output buffer.
ao(out___, 3, "hello");
</pre>

<p>When we see an <code>ihtml:dynamic</code> element with a
<code>pcdata</code> attribute, we invoke the compiler's
<code>emitHtmlChunk</code> operation wrapping the <code>pcdata</code>
expression in a call to a javascript function that escapes HTML
special characters.

<p>When we see another kind of <code>ihtml:dynamic</code> element we
ignore it since those are handled along with the HTML element
containing them.

<p>When we see a <code>ihtml:do</code> element we do the following:
<ol>
<li>For each identifier in the <code>vars</code> attribute we call
<code>lookupVar</code> on the element's <code>Renaming</code> instance
and add it to a list of vars to declare.  If that list is non-empty,
add a statement like <code class="prettyprint">var a0, a1, &hellip;</code>.
<li>If the <code>init</code> attribute is not present or is guaranted to return
a truthy value, then let <code>@initSideEffect</code> be the side effecting
portion of the <code>init</code> attribute and <code>@body</code> be the
result of recursing to the body, and append statements from expanding the
quasiliteral
<code class="prettyprint">@initSideEffect?; while (@while) @body;</code>.
<li>Else if the <code>while</code> attribute is not specified, let
<code>@body</code> be the result of recursing to the body,
and <code>@alternate</code> be the result of
recursing to the alternate, and append statements from expanding the
quasiliteral
<code class="prettyprint">if (@init) @body; else @alternate;</code>.
<li>Else append statements from expanding the quasiliteral
<code class="prettyprint">if (@init) { while (@while) @body; } else @alternate;
</code>.
</ol>

When we see a non-<code>ihtml</code> element e, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Let dTagName be the list of all
    <code>&lt;ihtml:dynamic tagName="&hellip;"&gt;</code> elements that are
    direct children of e.
<li>Let dAttrs be the list of all
    <code>&lt;ihtml:dynamic attribute="&hellip;"&gt;</code> elements that are
    direct children of e.
<li>Let dDynamic be the set of all <code>@name</code> such that an element in
    <code>dAttrs</code> does match the quasiliteral
    <code class="prettyprint">["@name", @value]</code>
<li>Let rChildren be the list of all direct children not in dTagName or dAttrs.
<li>Let sAttrs be the set of the names of all attributes on e.
<li>If dTagName is not null and its size is > 1, issue an error and set dTagName
    to null.
<li>If dTagName is not null, invoke <code>emitHtmlChunk('<')</code> followed by
    <pre class="prettyprint">
    emitHtmlChunk(
        QuasiBuilder.substV(
            "tn___ = ___.sanitizeTagName(@dTagName, @sTagName)",
            "dTagName", dTagName[0],
            "sTagName", StringLiteral.valueOf(e.getTagName)));</pre> where
    the <code>___.safeTagName</code> is a sanitizer that checks that
    its first argument is a white-listed element of the same kind as
    its second argument.  If that check fails, it may either return
    the second argument, or raise an exception.
<li>Else if dAttrNames is not empty,
    <pre class="prettyprint">
    emitHtmlChunk("<");
    emitHtmlChunk(QuasiBuilder.substV("tn___ = @dTagName",
                  "dTagName", StringLiteral.valueOf(e.getTagName())))</pre>
<li>Else <code class="prettyprint">emitHtmlChunk("<" + e.getTagName())</code>
<li>If dAttrs is not empty, append the statement <code>as___ = {};</code>
<li>For each element a in dAttrs, append the statement from expanding the
    quasiliteral
    <pre class="prettyprint">
    ap___ = @a;
    if (!(ap___[0] in as___) &amp;&amp; ___.sanitizeAttr(tn___, ap___)) {
      out___.push(' ', ap___[0], '="', ap___[1], '"')
      as___[ap___[0]] = true;  // So we don't write a dupe later.
    }</pre>
    where <code>___.sanitizeAttr</code> returns true iff the named
    attribute and value are allowed in the named tag, possibly rewriting
    the value in place.
<li>For each attribute a in sAttrs, append the statement from expanding the
    quasiliteral
    <pre class="prettyprint">if (!(@aname in as___)) out___.push(@aHtml);</pre>
    where <code>@aname</code> is the name of the attribute, and
    <code>@aHtml</code> is a space followed by a name, followed by
    <code>=</code> followed by the properly quoted and escaped attibute value
    followed by a close quote.
<li>Else for each attribute a in sAttrs, invoke <code>emitHtmlChunk</code>
    with a value computed as per <code class="prettyprint">@aHtml</code>
    in the previous step.
<li>If rChildren is not empty and dTagName is null and
    <code>e.getTagName()</code> is an empty
    element, invoke <code class="prettyprint">emitHtmlChunk(" /&gt;")</code>.
    We cannot always emit an end tag because HTML5 specifies that in
    some contexts, for <blockquote>An end tag whose tag name is "br",
    act as if a start tag token with the tag name "br" had been
    seen</blockquote>
<li>Else invoke <code class="prettyprint">emitHtmlChunk("&gt;")</code>
    and recurse to rChildren.
<li>Invoke <code class="prettyprint"
    >emitHtmlChunk("&lt;/" + e.getTagName() + "&gt;")</code>
</ol>

<p>When we see a text node do the following
<ol>
<li>If the containing non-ihtml element contains CDATA, then invoke
<code>emitHtmlChunk</code> with the value.  Maybe make sure that the
content does not contain the string <code>--&gt;</code> and wrap in an
escaping text span.  This containing non-ihtml element check works
because <code>ihtml:call</code> elements can only be found inside
PCDATA or RCDATA elements.
<li>Else invoke <code>emitHtmlChunk</code> with the properly escaped value.
</ol>



<h4>Compilation Unit Envelope</h4>
If the compilation unit contained one top-level template named foo, the envelope
would look like
<pre class="prettyprint">
(function (IMPORTS___) {
  // In this example, i1 is the only variable in the <a href="#import-set">import set</a>.
  // This import scheme will allow a template compiler to insert references
  // to cajoled support code, but will not allow template expressions to
  // modify imports after module load.
  var i1 = ___.readImport(IMPORTS, 'i1');

  // a0 is the <a href="#alpha-renaming">&alpha;-name</a> for the template foo, and a1 is the &alpha;-name of
  // its only formal paramater.
  function <b>a0</b>(out___, a1) { &hellip; }

  return {
    // It would be nice if foo could show up as the name of the function so
    // that it would show in stacktraces, but then the name would be in scope
    // in the function below, which might mask names produced by the
    // alpha-renamer.
    <b>foo</b>: function (a1) {
      var out___ = [];
      a0(out___, a1);
      return trademarkHtml(out___.join(''));
    }
  };
})
</pre>

<h3>Dynamic Sanitizes</h3>
<p>The code generated above defines several sanitizer and escaping methods.
<dl>
<dt><code>___.sanitizeTagName</code>
<dd>Given a dynamic tag name, and a known good tag name
    (in (DIV, SPAN, THEAD, or TR))
    returns the first if it can appear wherever the known good one can without
    extra required attributes, and otherwise errors out or returns the known
    good one.
    Uses client side schemas.
<dt><code>___.sanitizeAttr</code>
<dd>Takes a tag name, and an array containing a name and value, and
    returns true if the attribute is allowed, and possibly normalizes or
    rewrites the value.
    Uses client side schemas.
<dt>an HTML escaping method
<dd>Remove characters not allowed in XML (such as NUL U+0, and BOM U+FEFF) and
    rewrite all HTML special characters to entities including those
    special in attribute values.
</dl>

<h2>Possible Extensions</h2>
<h3>Scoped style rules via <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;</code> elements in templates</h3>
If a <code>STYLE</code> element appears in a script block, we could
apply the CSS schemas at a stylesheet level, and scope all rules by
generating a GUID and using it both in a class at the top of the template
output, and prefixing style rules.  E.g., if the GUID were 1234, then
we would add a <code>&lt;div class="s1234"&gt;</code> around the
template body (or SPAN if the template does not contribute block level
children), and convert each style rule by prefixing with the GUID as in
<code class="prettyprint lang-css">p { color: purple }</code> &rarr;
<code class="prettyprint lang-css">.s1234 p { color: purple }</code>.

<h3>CSS templates via expressions embedded in
<code>style="&hellip;"</code> attributes</h3>
Our static CSS schemas are much more flexible than the client side ones, and
have facilities to require constraints on placeholders as in
<pre class="prettyprint"
>&lt;div style="width: $(w)px; height: $(h + 10)px"&gt;
  &hellip;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
We can expose these so that template compiler implementors can allow
template parameters to be used to compute positions and URLs flexibly
and without the possibility of quoting confusion.

<h3>DHTML Behaviors via <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> elements in templates</h3>
<p>We could emulate DHTML behaviors as in
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!-- blink using javascript, because we can --&gt;
&lt;span class="blinky"&gt;$i_blink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  // Properly scoped virtual document that only affects the template
  // generated sub-tree.
  document.getElementsByClassName('blinky').style.textDecoration = 'blink';
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
where the script is pulled out and stored as a promise that is realized
when the HTML is added to the real DOM.
<p>Though this example isn't useful, behaviors can be used to wire up
widgets that contain a Google Maps or other gadget that can't be generated
by a callable template.

<h3 id="gadgets-zero-arg">Gadgets as Zero-Argument Templates</h3>
<p>Similar to DHTML behaviors, an opensocial gadget is an HTML page with
interleaved script elements.  To improve latency, we'd like to be able
to render CSS and HTML before downloading, parsing, or running scripts
<p>If we treat a gadget as a zero-argument template, we can convert a
gadget like:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;h1&gt;My Gadget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  foo();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;a onclick="hello()"&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
into a static HTML part and a script part
<table>
<tr>
<td><pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;!-- With script off, works as expected.
    -  (CAVEAT: noscript content not manipulable by JS on IE)
   --&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My Gadget&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;!-- Each node opened between the n-th and (n+1)-th script elements
    -  that is not contained in an element also opened between the n-th and
    -  (n+1)-th script elements has the class afterScript&lt;n&gt;___.
   --&gt;
  &lt;a class="tmp0123___ afterScript0___"&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
</pre>
<td><pre class="prettyprint">
// Script elements are cajoled to functions
var scripts = [ function () { /* Cajoled version of foo() */ } ];
// A side-table of dynamic attributes which can evaluate dynamic bits
// in the context of this instance of the module.
var dynamicBits = [ ['tmp0123___', 'onclick', /* extracted handler */ ] ];

var moduleRoot = document.createElement('DIV');
// Non-dynamic bits of gadget parsed at HTML parser speed.
// No IE6 confusion around document.appendChild(whitespaceTextNode)
moduleRoot.innerHTML = noScriptElement.innerText;

// Reattach dynamicBits to moduleRoot.
&hellip;

// Pull out everything with class afterScript#___, so that each script
// is executed in the context of only elements that appear before it.
var extractedNodes = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt;= scripts.length; ++i) {
  // getElementsByTagName is required to produce results in a preorder
  // traversal.
  var els = moduleRoot.getElementsByTagName('afterScript' + i + '___');
  var wave = extractedNodes[i] = [];
  for (var j = els.length; --j &gt;= 0;) {
    // TODO: If the node was a text node wrapped in a span solely so that it
    // could be marked with a wave class, throw away the span.
    wave[j] = [els[j], els[j].parentNode];
    removeClass(els[j], 'afterScript' + i + '___');
  }
}

for (var i = 0; i &lt;= scripts.length; ++i) {
  try {  // Execute script0
    scripts[i]();
  } catch (e) {
    // Simulate window.onerror
  }

  // Put back removed bits.
  var wave = extractedNodes[i];
  for (var j = 0; j &lt; wave.length; ++j) {
    wave[j][1].appendChild(wave[j][0]);
  }
}
</pre>
</table>

<p>This HTML generation needs to happen after any text-localization and
any automatic LTR&rarr;RTL restyling.</p>

<h3 id="auto-rtl">Automatic Bidi support</h3>
<p>Since we have to parse style properties and stylesheets so that we
can apply schemas, it would be quite easy to rewrite style properties
(<code>padding-left</code>, <code>margin-left</code>), style values
(<code>text-align: left</code>) and the HTML
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html"><code>DIR</code>
attribute</a> when the input locale is for an RTL language.</p>


<h2>Assumptions and Invariants</h2>
<p>For each of the elements that can contain dynamic tag names
(DIV, SPAN, TBODY, TR), we can identify which tag names can safely
go there by comparing allowed attributes and attribute criteria.
E.g., we can say that a DIV element can be turned into a P element
by a <code>&lt;ihtml:dynamic tagName="'P'"&gt;</code> safely since
attributes allowed on DIV always have the same meaning on P.

<p>If an HTML element that a template can produce can contain one of any
other type of element then it can contain any number, or security
policies don't rely on this not being true.  Our schemas don't
whitelist HTML or HEAD so this should hold.  This is why the "union"
clause under IHTML holds in the presence of <code>ihtml:do</code>
alternates and initially false conditions.

<p>Dynamically attributes are not represented as placeholders in
the output.  Specifically, when compiling <code>&lt;a href="$foo"&gt;</code>
the IHTML tree does not contain a blank href attribute since then we
would be relying on a blank href to be replaced which might violate
our security policy.  We are secure against intermediate invalid forms
of the template escaping because we never transition through an invalid
state.

<p>An HTML schema must not rely on preserving the relationship between
two or more attributes for security properties.  E.g., if a security
policy might be violated by an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> element without
an appropriate <code>target</code> attribute, then it must mandate one
regardless of whether there is an <code>href</code> attribute.
If this holds, then it is safe for a dynamic attribute of the same name
to trump a statically specified one.

<p>A template output is only injected into a node that accepts PCDATA
content and can contain arbitrary block or inline elements.
A template might produce output that contains a single text node which is a
valid javascript string, and which should not be injected into a
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element.
The HTML schemas contain a whitelist of elements that are safe this way.

<p>if resolving dynamic bits requires looking up DOM nodes in a tree,
it is done in a way that is properly scoped, and done until no more
matches are found.  Even if a string of HTML contains only one tag
with a given ID, due to the adoption agency algorithm, the parsed
DOM might contain multiple elements with that ID, as in
<code class="prettyprint"
>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i id="x"&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;bar&lt;/i&gt;</code>

<p>When multiple templates appear in the same compilation unit and
call one another, malicious code cannot mask or replace a template
function.  Templates within a compilation unit must share some
scope that is not manipulable by malicious code.  If this does not
hold, then an attacker could use a man-in-the-middle to return
invalid HTML which would cause the caller to improperly trademark
an invalid output.

<h2>Work Estimates</h2>
<p>Defining schemas and doing schema validation is already done, as are
facilities for parsing JS/CSS/HTML and manipulating parse trees.
<p>Client side schemas are already done, as are versions of the
client side sanitization methods.
<p>The bulk of the work would be in implementing the IHTML&rarr;JS compiler
which is specified as a fairly simple transform.  Probably one week.
<p>Before this can be tested though, we would need to implement a
template compiler.  Perhaps something with simple perl style "$string"
interpolation anywhere with if &amp; foreach tags using javascript as the
expression language.  That could be implemented quickly on top of the
existing DOM parser.
<p>Porting a more serious templating language like OSML or YML would
take longer the first time through since significant debugging of the
IHTML&rarr;JS compiler can only happen in parallel.
