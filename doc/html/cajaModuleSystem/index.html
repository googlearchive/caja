<h1>Caja Module System</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the manner in which Caja code is composed
at run-time.</p>

<h2>Overview of Cajoling</h2>

<p>Caja code is JavaScript code that conforms to the fail-stop subset
of JavaScript defined by the Caja specification. A conforming Caja
system <em>cajoles</em> a Caja input program, producing as output a
Caja <em>module</em>. A Caja module is a unit of JavaScript code with
the following well-known top-level structure:</p>

<pre>
___.loadModule(function(___IMPORTS___) {
  <em>... translated code here ...</em>
});
</pre>

<p>The anonymous function defined by this stereotypical structure is
called the <em>module function</em>.</p>

<h2>Module instantiation</h2>

<p>Caja modules run within a <em>container</em> which acts as an OS
kernel. Part or all of the container is written in native JavaScript
and runs with full authority.</p>

<p>A Caja container <em>instantiates</em> a module by calling its
module function. By design, the module function cannot save state
between invocations, so that each instance of a module is an isolate.
Module instances may only communicate with the outside world as
arranged by their container.</p>

<p>A Caja container instantiates modules as part of a boot-up process,
as a result of some configuration, or at the behest of other
modules.</p>

<h2>Free variables</h2>

<p>The <em>free variables</em> of a block of Caja code are the
variables which are not explicitly declared in the scope chain
enclosing their point of use. For example, in the following:</p>

<pre>
var x = 0;
y.foo = 3;
function() {
  z.bar = 4;
}
</pre>

<p>The variables <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, but not
<code>x</code>, are free variables.</p>

<h2>Imports lists</h2>

<p>The <code>___IMPORTS___</code> parameter to the module function is
called the module's <em>imports list</em>. It is an object the
properties of which are the capabilities provided to the module by the
container.</p>

<p>The free variables of a Caja block are rewritten to be references
to its imports list. For example, the reference to <code>y</code> in
the previous example would be rewritten as follows (highly simplified
for clarity):</p>

<pre>
___IMPORTS___.y.foo = 3;
</pre>

<p>Caja code is rewritten such that referring to a non-existent member
of the imports list throws a <code>ReferenceError</code>. This mimics
the behavior of references to undefined variables in the global scope
of a JavaScript program.</p>

<h2>Pre-defined imports</h2>

<p>Some members of the imports list of a module are present without
the module's code having to make any special effort.</p>

<h3>Built-in objects</h3>

<p>The JavaScript built-in objects such as <code>Object</code> and
<code>Array</code> must be provided to each module, as listed in
Section 4.2 of Ecma-262 and restricted in semantics and availability
by the Caja specification.</p>

<h3>Caja entry points</h3>

<p>Two Caja entry points are provided for each module.
<code>caja</code> refers to a powerless helper object implementing
that part of the Caja microkernel that is directly visible to the
programmer. <code>modules</code> is an object allowing the program to
modify its imports list and provide objects for the imports lists of
other modules.</p>

<h3>Application specific objects</h3>

<p>Container implementations may choose to add more default objects to
the imports lists of modules they host. For example, a container used
for Web content may define a <code>document</code> serving as a secure
alternative to the eponymous object provided by Web browsers.</p>

<h2>The <code>modules</code> object</h2>

<p>The <code>modules</code> object is the visible entry point into the
module system.</p>

<h3><code>modules.import(url)</code></h3>

<p>Instantiates the named module and loads its exported symbols into
this module's imports list.</p>

<p><code>url</code> &mdash; the URL of a module.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> a truthy value on success, or a falsy
value on failure.</p>

<pre>
try {
  foo.doSomething(3, 4);
} catch (e) {
  // ReferenceError since 'foo' not defined
}

// The following module exports 'foo'
modules.import('http://example.com/aModule.js');

// Now the following will succeed
foo.doSomething(3, 4);
</pre>

<h3><code>modules.importValue(url)</code></h3>

<p>Similar to <code>modules.import</code>, but returns the module's
symbols as the properties of an object.</p>

<p><code>url</code> &mdash; the URL of a module.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> an object the properties of which are the
symbols exported by the module being loaded.</p>

<pre>
var exm = modules.importValue('http://example.com/aModule.js');
exm.foo.doSomething(3, 4);
</pre>

<h3><code>modules.export(name, value)</code></h3>

<p>Export a symbol to the container or to a module that is
instantiating this module.</p>

<p><code>name</code> &mdash; the name under which to export an
object.</p>

<p><code>value</code> &mdash; an object being exported.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> a truthy value on success, or a falsy
value on failure.</p>

<pre>
function aFunc(x, y) { return x + y; }

modules.export('foo', aFunc);
modules.export('bar', caja.freeze({ baz: 4 }));
</pre>

<h2>Unresolved issues</h2>

<p>What happens if I call <code>delete</code> on, or assign to, a free
variable? Does the behavior differ depending on whether or not the
variable is currently in my imports list?</p>

<p>How do we ensure that a module's URL is valid Caja?</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Caja works by adding run-time checks to a language that is not
intrinsically capability safe. Hence, to maintain the invariants
relied upon by Caja, the cajoled output must be run in a very specific
fashion. This is why we need <em>at least</em> the module function
structure:</p>

<pre>
___.loadModule(function(___IMPORTS___) {
  <em>... translated code ...</em>
});
</pre>

<p>Symbols that a module requires -- the free variables of the
untranslated code -- must be provided by the container as fields of
<code>___IMPORTS___</code>. If the container does not provide these
fields, the result is a <code>ReferenceError</code> at run-time. Hence
our interface so far mimics function calls in a dynamically typed
language.</p>

<p>Since JavaScript (&le; 3.<em>x</em> at any rate) is dynamically
typed, there is no distinction between "importing" code ("classes" and
functions) and binding to run-time objects supplied by the caller. Our
mechanism of passing material in <code>___IMPORTS___</code> is all we
need.</p>

<p>A module should be able to export objects to its container (which
may in turn make these symbols available to other modules). To achieve
this, the container must provide an object in
<code>___IMPORTS___</code> into which modules can put things they want
to share. At some point during or after the module function is
executed, the module will call back to that object to provide the
container with the data. For example:</p>

<pre>
___IMPORTS___.exportedSymbols.add("foo", myFooObject);
</pre>
