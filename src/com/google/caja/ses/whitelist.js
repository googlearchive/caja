/**
 * @fileoverview Exports "whitelist", a recursively defined JSON
 * record enumerating all the naming paths in the ES5.1 spec, those
 * de-facto extensions that we judge to be safe, and SES and Dr. SES
 * extensions provided by the SES runtime.
 *
 * <p>Each JSON record enumerates the disposition of the properties on
 * some corresponding primordial object, with the root record
 * representing the global object. For each such record, the values
 * associated with its property names can be
 * <ul>
 * <li>Another record, in which case this property is simply
 *     whitelisted and that next record represents the disposition of
 *     the object which is its value. For example, {@code "Object"}
 *     leads to another record explaining what properties {@code
 *     "Object"} may have and how each such property, if present,
 *     and its value should be tamed.
 * <li>true, in which case this property is simply whitelisted. The
 *     value associated with that property is still traversed and
 *     tamed, but only according to the taming of the objects that
 *     object inherits from. For example, {@code "Object.freeze"} leads
 *     to true, meaning that the {@code "freeze"} property of {@code
 *     Object} should be whitelisted and the value of the property (a
 *     function) should be further tamed only according to the
 *     markings of the other objects it inherits from, like {@code
 *     "Function.prototype"} and {@code "Object.prototype").
 * <li>"*", in which case this property on this object is whitelisted,
 *     as is this property as inherited by all objects that inherit
 *     from this object. The values associated with all such properties
 *     are still traversed and tamed, but only according to the taming
 *     of the objects that object inherits from. For example, {@code
 *     "Object.prototype.constructor"} leads to "*", meaning that we
 *     whitelist the {@code "constructor"} property on {@code
 *     Object.prototype} and on every object that inherits from {@code
 *     Object.prototype} that does not have a conflicting mark. Each
 *     of these is tamed as if with true, so that the value of the
 *     property is further tamed according to what other objects it
 *     inherits from.
 * <li>"skip", in which case this property on this object is simply
 *     whitelisted, as is this property as inherited by all objects
 *     that inherit from this object, but we avoid taming the value
 *     associated with that property. For example, as of this writing
 *     {@code "Function.prototype.caller"} leads to "skip" because
 *     some current browser bugs prevent us from removing or even
 *     traversing this property on some platforms of interest.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The "skip" markings are workarounds for browser bugs or other
 * temporary problems. For each of these, there should be an
 * explanatory comment explaining why or a bug citation
 * (TODO(erights)). Any of these whose comments say "fatal" need to be
 * fixed before SES might be considered safe. Ideally, we can retire
 * all "skip" entries by the time SES is ready for secure production
 * use.
 *
 * The members of the whitelist are either
 * <ul>
 * <li>(uncommented) defined by the ES5.1 normative standard text,
 * <li>(questionable) provides a source of non-determinism, in
 *     violation of pure object-capability rules, but allowed anyway
 *     since we've given up on restricting JavaScript to a
 *     deterministic subset.
 * <li>(ES5 Appendix B) common elements of de facto JavaScript
 *     described by the non-normative Appendix B.
 * <li>(Harmless whatwg) extensions documented at
 *     <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript"
 *     >http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript</a> that seem to be
 *     harmless. Note that the RegExp constructor extensions on that
 *     page are <b>not harmless</b> and so must not be whitelisted.
 * <li>(ES-Harmony proposal) accepted as "proposal" status for
 *     EcmaScript-Harmony.
 * <li>(Marked as "skip") See above.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>With the above encoding, there are some sensible whitelists we
 * cannot express, such as marking a property both with "*" and a JSON
 * record. This is an expedient decision based only on not having
 * encountered such a need. Should we need this extra expressiveness,
 * we'll need to refactor to enable a different encoding.
 *
 * <p>We factor out {@code true} and {@code "skip"} into the variables
 * {@code t} and {@code s} just to get a bit better compression from
 * simple minifiers.
