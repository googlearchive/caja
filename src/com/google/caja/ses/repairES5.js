 * <p>Assumes only ES3, but only proceeds to do useful repairs when

 * repairs. Compatible with almost-ES5, ES5, ES5-strict, and
 * anticipated ES6.

 * create it, use it, and delete it all within this module. But we
 * need to lie to the linter since it can't tell.

/**
 * <p>Qualifying platforms generally include all JavaScript platforms
 * shown on <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"
 * >ECMAScript 5 compatibility table</a> that implement {@code
 * Object.getOwnPropertyNames}. At the time of this writing,
 * qualifying browsers already include the latest released versions of
 * Internet Explorer (9), Firefox (4), Chrome (11), and Safari
 * (5.0.5), their corresponding standalone (e.g., server-side) JavaScript
 * engines, Rhino 1.73, BESEN.
 *
 * <p>On such not-quite-ES5 platforms, some elements of these
 * emulations may lose SES safety, as enumerated in the comment on
 * each kludge record in the {@code kludges} array below. The platform
 * must at least provide {@code Object.getOwnPropertyNames}, because
 * it cannot reasonably be emulated.
 *
 * <p>This file is useful by itself, as it has no dependencies on the
 * rest of SES. It creates no new global bindings, but merely repairs
 * standard globals or standard elements reachable from standard
 * globals. If the future-standard {@code WeakMap} global is present,
 * as it is currently on FF7.0a1, then it will repair it in place. The
 * one non-standard element that this file uses is {@code console} if
 * present, in order to report the repairs it found necessary, in
 * which case we use its {@code log, info, warn, and error}
 * methods. If {@code console.log} is absent, then this file performs
 * its repairs silently.
 *
 * <p>Generally, this file should be run as the first script in a
 * JavaScript context (i.e. a browser frame), as it replies on other
 * primordial objects and methods not yet being perturbed.
 *
 * <p>TODO(erights): This file tries to protects itself from most
 * post-initialization perturbation, by stashing the primordials it
 * needs for later use, but this attempt is currently incomplete. We
 * need to revisit this when we support Confined-ES5, as a variant of
 * SES in which the primordials are not frozen.

  /**
   * Actual bound functions are not supposed to have a prototype, and

   * functions written in JavaScript cannot avoid having a 'prototype'
   * property, and cannot reliably distinguish between being called as
   * a function vs as a constructor, i.e., by {@code new}.
   *
   * <p>Since the repair_MISSING_BIND emulation below produces a bound
   * function written in JavaScript, it cannot faithfully emulate
   * either the lack of a 'prototype' property nor the currying of the
   * [[Construct]] behavior. So instead, we use BOGUS_BOUND_PROTOTYPE
   * to reliably give an error for attempts to {@code new} a bound
   * function. Since we cannot avoid exposing BOGUS_BOUND_PROTOTYPE
   * itself, it is possible to pass in a this-binding which inherits
   * from it without using {@code new}, which will also trigger our
   * error case. Whether this latter error is appropriate or not, it
   * still fails safe.
   *
   * <p>By making the 'prototype' of the bound function be the same as
   * the current {@code thisFunc.prototype}, we could have emulated
   * the [[HasInstance]] property of bound functions. But even this
   * would have been inaccurate, since we would be unable to track
   * changes to the original {@code thisFunc.prototype}. (We cannot
   * make 'prototype' into an accessor to do this tracking, since
   * 'prototype' on a function written in JavaScript is
   * non-configurable.) And this one partially faithful emulation
   * would have come at the cost of no longer being able to reasonably
   * detect construction, in order to safely reject it.
