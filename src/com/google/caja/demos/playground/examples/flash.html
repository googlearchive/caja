<p>
Caja does not allow <code>object</code> or <code>embed</code> tags in HTML.
However, a container may provide an JavaScript API for embedding flash
on a page.  A common library that provides this functionality is <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">SWFObject</a>.  The Caja Playground provides a tamed version
of the <code>swfobject.embedSWF</code> which you can use to embed flash
objects which to not need to interact with scripts on the page.
<p>
For example, here is a YouTube video.
<p>
  <div id="status">Loading...</div>
  <div id="ytapiplayer">
    You need Flash player 8+ and JavaScript enabled to view this video.
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript">

    var params = { allowScriptAccess: "always" };
    var atts = { id: "myytplayer" };
    swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.youtube.com/v/0AqMb-edXlc", // Flash video
                       "ytapiplayer", // id of div to place flash object
                       "480", "390",  // width and height
                       "8",           // minimum version
                       null,          // expressInstall
                       null, params, atts, // flashvars, params and attributes
                       function () { document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = ""; }); // callback
  </script>
<p>
This works by creating a <code>div</code> where the Flash object will be
placed.  A tame version of SWFObject is exposed to the gadget which in
turn uses the real SWFObject to add the flash in a cross-browser
supported fashion.  Some of the parameters maybe modified by the
container before being passed to the real SWFObject.  For example, the
Caja Playground requires a minimum Flash version of 9 and does not
allow script access to the page, inspite of what was requested by the
gadget.
<p>
Other Caja containers (such as iGoogle or Orkut) may give you a
different JavaScript API for embedding flash in your page and possibly
allow your Flash object to interact with the rest of the page.
