Google Caja - "Photon" gadgets demo
-----------------------------------

1. Establish a Caja cajoling service at some URL. For this example, we will
   assume that the service is at:

     http://caja.appspot.com/

   If you wish to run your own server, go to the top level of the google-caja
   directory and run the Ant task:

     ant runserver

   This will run a cajoling service at the URL:

     http://localhost:8080/

2. Publish the directory containing this file at some other URL which *must*
   be accessible to the cajoling service. For this example, we will asssume
   that you have published the directory such that the file you are reading is
   accessible as:

     http://example.com/photon/README

3. With your browser, open the following URL to use caja.appspot.com:

     http://example.com/photon/container/index.html

   and the following to use your localhost cajoling service:

     http://example.com/photon/container/index.html?cajaServer=http://localhost:8080/
