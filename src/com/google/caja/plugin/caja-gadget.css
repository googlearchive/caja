 * Common CSS rules to use for all Caja gadgets.
 *
 * The class name “vdoc-container___” is automatically applied to all elements
 * in host pages which are the root of a virtual document for a gadget. The
 * style rules in this file ensure that (a) the content of such elements does
 * not cover any other areas of the page, and that (b) the coordinate system for
 * CSS absolute positioning is relative to that element.
