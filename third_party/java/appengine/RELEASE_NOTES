Version 1.5.0
=============
- Support for Backends which allow developers to create infrastructure
  components that complement the existing dynamic apps that App Engine already
  provides. Instances of a backend can maintain state, be addressed
  individually, and are not subject to per-request time limits. They can also be
  configured to consume more memory and CPU than ordinary dynamic instances.
- Task Queues support pull mode, allowing for more control over task queue work
  rates. To use pull queues, include the 'mode' element in your queue.xml.
- Pull queues are supported by a REST API, allowing access from outside App
  Engine. To use the REST API, you must also include a valid ACL section
  specifying which users can lease tasks from the pull queue.
- Task Queue payload limits have been increased. Queues support 100KB per task.
  Within App Engine, the new limit is 32 MB per batch of tasks. With the REST
  API the limit is 1 MB per batch.
- HTTP request and response sizes have been increased to 32 MB.
- We have removed the rate quotas for requests, datastore operations,
  memcache operations, and image API operations. Resource quotas still apply.
- When creating new applications, developers will now see the High Replication
  Datastore as the default configuration option.  Developers that still wish to
  use the Master/Slave configuration must explicitly choose this option at
  application creation time.
- The Task Queue maximum configurable processing rate has been increased to
  500/s.
- Modified Dashboard latency graphs to indicate they only include dynamic
  requests.
- We have added two restrictions to the Mail API to improve the reliability
  of the service for all applications.
  - Emails must be sent from email accounts managed by Google (either Gmail or
    a domain signed up for Google Apps).
  - Reduced the number of free recipients per day from 2000 to 100 for new
    applications.
- Fixed an issue where the Javadoc for the File API was not generated.
- Fixed an issue where the API Deadlines were not being enforced in the SDK.

  fail.

- The Admin Console Task Queues page now displays a more accurate estimate of
  queue size for queues containing more than 2000 tasks.
- Java applications can enable concurrent request support by setting
  <threadsafe> to True in their appengine-web.xml. This flag indicates that
  request handlers for your app are thread safe and multiple request handlers
  may safely run at the same time in the same memory space for your application.
- Deferred library support now available in Java.

- The maximum rate per queue at which tasks are processed has been increased to
  100 task per second.
- The maximum number of concurrent requests for a single queue can be specified

  of rate limiting. The current number of running tasks is also displayed in
  the Admin Console.
- Metadata queries in the Datastore now support cursors.
- Admin Console logs viewer now displays time as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm.

Version 1.4.1
=============
There were no updates to the Java SDK for the 1.4.1 App Engine release.

Version 1.4.0
=============
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's appengine-web.xml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to
  initialize new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the
  latency an end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry-parameters in their
  queue.xml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URL Fetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB. 
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- Added a low-level AysncDatastoreService for making calls to the datastore
  asynchronously.
- Added a getBodyAsBytes() method to QueueStateInfo.TaskStateInfo, this returns
  the body of the task state as a pure byte-string.
- The whitelist has been updated to include all classes from javax.xml.soap.
- Fixed an issue sending email to multiple recipients.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1623
- Revert the default logging level during GWT hosted mode back to INFO.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4011

  sessions. For more information see:
    http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599
- In queue.xml, the maximum allowed bucket size is now 100.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- The whitelist has been updated to include java.net.InetAddress and some
  interfaces and abstract classes in javax.xml.soap, including
  javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of emails containing periods,
  multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1196
- Fixed an issue where TaskOptions had no public getters, making testing
  impossible.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3243
- Fixed an issue on the development server where PNGs were being returned as
  JPEGs.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3661
