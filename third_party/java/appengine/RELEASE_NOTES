  properties with the same performance and cost of a keys-only query. This
  feature is experimental.
- In the High Replication Datastore, there is a new metadata kind,
  __entity_group__, that has a numeric __version__ property. This property is
  guaranteed to increase on every change to the entity group.

  are now being charged for that storage at $0.24/GB/month (the first gigabyte
  of logs storage is free). All logs beyond an application's specified storage
  limit will be deleted. Please examine your Application Settings page to verify
  you are retaining the desired amount of logs.
- Datastore statistics now show the amount of storage used by application
  indexes.
- We have released an experimental utility for migrating your application's
  blobs at the same time you migrate your datastore data. You can opt-in to

  a warning. Starting with the 1.6.5 release, omitting this directive will
  result in an error.
- You can set an RPC deadline for the Task Queue API's leaseTasks() method.
- The Datastore Admin tab in the Admin Console now shows entities from every
  namespace.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3962

Version 1.6.3
=============
- In the Admin Console, you can use the new Traffic Splitting feature to send a
  certain percentage of traffic to a non-default application version. The
  traffic is split by either cookie or IP address.
- Emails that are sent from Google Apps domains email addresses where the domain
  has been set up to use DKIM will be signed: when an email was from a request
  that originated on that app's domain or any time the email was sent from
  an app adminstrator, including when that email is sent from a cron job or task
  queue request.
- In the Admin Console, you can now choose how much and how long you'd like to
  store logs.  All apps get 1G for free and eventually will be able to pay for
  more, while the amount can be increased this release we won't start charging
  for the additional capacity until the next release at the earliest.
- The instances screen in the Admin Console now has a button to shut down
  a specific instance.
- Each application log has a link to the instance that served the request. If
  the instance is no longer serving requests, a message will be displayed.

  with which to enhance your JDO/JPA classes.
- The dev appserver command line now supports the --generated_dir flag, which
  allows you to specify a directory in which to write files generated by the
  SDK.
- Fixed a StackOverflowError when using the Remote API.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6349

Version 1.6.2
=============
- The Admin Console Datastore Admin has added experimental backup and restore
  functionality. The job occurs within your application and counts against your
  application quota, including Instance Hours, Datastore Ops and Datastore
  Storage.
- Developers can now specify how long a channel token will last until it
  expires, with the default remaining two hours. Channel API quota is now
  measured both in calls to create a channel and the number of hours of channel
  time requested. The maximum hours of quota is the maximum number of channel
  creation calls * 2, so free apps get 200 hours of requested channel token
  time.
- Task Queue API requests now include a X-Appengine-TaskETA header, that can be
  used to measure task delivery latency.
- We have removed the deprecated labs version of the TaskQueue API.
- The default API deadlines for Blobstore API calls have been raised to 15s for
  online and 30s for offline requests, up from 5s.

  default, as it does in production.
- Fixed an issue with the Images API where valid images were returning a
  NotImageError.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5545

Version 1.6.1
=============
- You can now configure Frontend Instance Classes from your Admin Console's
  application settings page. Three classes are available, with increasing
  memory, CPU limits, and associated cost. By default, all applications use the
  basic frontend instance setting of 128MB memory and 600MHz CPU.
- We've added new functionality to the Log API that will allow you to read your
  application's logs programmatically.
- We are releasing an experimental Conversion API that will allow you to convert
  between document types including .doc, .html, .pdf, images using OCR, and
  more.

  minimum number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- Task Queue storage has been separated in to its own line item. Previously,
  this was included in Datastore storage.
- We have released an experimental utility, available in the Admin Console, to
  assist in migrating your application to the High Replication datastore. This
  utility allows you to copy the bulk of your data in the background, while the
  source application is still serving. You then need a brief read-only period to
  migrate your application data while you copy the data that has changed from
  the time the original copy started.

  that points to the same reference as the key's parent.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2088
- Fixed an issue where DoS stats in the Admin Console didn't work for High
  Replication apps.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5237
- WARNING: Starting with 1.6.1 (our next release, NOT this release), URLFetch
  requests will honor the Accept-Encoding header. If your code sets this header

Version 1.5.4
=============
- You can now specify the maximum size for a blob in
  BlobstoreService.createUploadUrl().
- Zigzag merge join queries will now continue scanning up to the 30 second
  Datastore query deadline. For zigzag queries that used to generate
  DatastoreNeedIndexException, many will now succeed. A small percentage will
  now instead timeout.
- The SDK datastore viewer in the dev console now displays the number of "Write
  Ops" for each entity. "Write Ops" are the total number of entity and index
  writes that were required to create the entity.

  is still experimental, so applications will be limited to a maximum of 1000
  subscriptions.
- We made a classloading improvement that we expect to help loading request
  latencies for projects with large numbers of jars.
- Added support for the set_default_version flag to Appcfg.
- The Java Remote API now recognizes the HTTP_X_APPENGINE_INBOUND_APPID. This
  means that the Datastore Admin copy functionality will work when using
  Java's Remote API with the destination app.
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed creation of tasks with whitespace in
  the url.
- Fixed the error message for "transaction not found" to be more descriptive.
- Fixed an issue with the dev appserver's local Blobstore implementation trying
  to modify an immutable collection.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3081

    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/appidentity/overview.html
- Added an improved HRD migration tool that requires a read-only period relative
  to your datastore write rate (as opposed to your datastore size, which is how
  the current version behaves). The tool is not yet generally available.  If you
  are interested in being an early adopter please fill out this form:
  http://goo.gl/3jrXu
- Fixed an issue in the Channel API where jsapi was not served with the correct
  mime type.
- Fixed an issue where blobs could not be uploaded using HTTPS.

Version 1.5.2
=============
- You can now specify the minimum pending latency for instances and the maximum
  number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- The datastore now never requires an exploding index.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries.html#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes

Version 1.5.0.1
===============
- Fixed a bug that caused appengine-jsr107cache-1.5.0.jar to be empty.

Version 1.5.0
=============
- Support for Backends which allow developers to create infrastructure
  components that complement the existing dynamic apps that App Engine already
  provides. Instances of a backend can maintain state, be addressed
  individually, and are not subject to per-request time limits. They can also be
  configured to consume more memory and CPU than ordinary dynamic instances.
- Task Queues support pull mode, allowing for more control over task queue work
  rates. To use pull queues, include the 'mode' element in your queue.xml.
- Pull queues are supported by a REST API, allowing access from outside App
  Engine. To use the REST API, you must also include a valid ACL section
  specifying which users can lease tasks from the pull queue.
- Task Queue payload limits have been increased. Queues support 100KB per task.
  Within App Engine, the new limit is 32 MB per batch of tasks. With the REST
  API the limit is 1 MB per batch.
- HTTP request and response sizes have been increased to 32 MB.
- We have removed the rate quotas for requests, datastore operations,
  memcache operations, and image API operations. Resource quotas still apply.
- When creating new applications, developers will now see the High Replication
  Datastore as the default configuration option.  Developers that still wish to
  use the Master/Slave configuration must explicitly choose this option at
  application creation time.
- The Task Queue maximum configurable processing rate has been increased to
  500/s.
- Modified Dashboard latency graphs to indicate they only include dynamic
  requests.
- We have added two restrictions to the Mail API to improve the reliability
  of the service for all applications.
  - Emails must be sent from email accounts managed by Google (either Gmail or
    a domain signed up for Google Apps).
  - Reduced the number of free recipients per day from 2000 to 100 for new
    applications.
- Fixed an issue where the Javadoc for the File API was not generated.
- Fixed an issue where the API Deadlines were not being enforced in the SDK.

Version 1.4.1
=============
There were no updates to the Java SDK for the 1.4.1 App Engine release.

Version 1.4.0
=============
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's appengine-web.xml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to
  initialize new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the
  latency an end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry-parameters in their
  queue.xml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URL Fetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB.
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- Added a low-level AysncDatastoreService for making calls to the datastore
  asynchronously.
- Added a getBodyAsBytes() method to QueueStateInfo.TaskStateInfo, this returns
  the body of the task state as a pure byte-string.
- The whitelist has been updated to include all classes from javax.xml.soap.
- Fixed an issue sending email to multiple recipients.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1623

  sessions. For more information see:
    http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599
- In queue.xml, the maximum allowed bucket size is now 100.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- The whitelist has been updated to include java.net.InetAddress and some
  interfaces and abstract classes in javax.xml.soap, including
  javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of emails containing periods,
  multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1196
- Fixed an issue where TaskOptions had no public getters, making testing
  impossible.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3243
- Fixed an issue on the development server where PNGs were being returned as
  JPEGs.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3661
